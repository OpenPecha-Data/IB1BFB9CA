	<h2>The Lamp That Illuminates the Excellent Path of Great Bliss</h2>
<h3>A Guide<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> to the Practice Text of the Female Awareness-Holder, the Queen of Great Bliss<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></h3>
<p><strong><em>by Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpe Nyima</em></strong></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>With great respect I prostrate at the feet of my kind root master, indivisible from Padmasambhava, the great master from Uá¸á¸iyÄna, together with his consort, his heart-disciples and their lineages. I take refuge in you! Please grant your blessings!</p>
<p>In order to lead, as in an optical illusion, superior disciples swiftly along the path of great bliss to the level of Buddhahood, our teacher Vajradhara manifested immeasurable maá¹á¸alas of vajra á¸ÄkinÄ«s. The <em>Arising of Saá¹vara Tantra</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The supreme chief among the inhabitants of JambudvÄ«pa<br/>
Will be born in the central land...<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the centre of the land of JambudvÄ«pa is the Vajra Seat, about a hundred <em>yojana</em>s<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> from which is the land renowned as Tibet. This was the country of the Lord of Men, Tri Songdetsen,<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> an emanation of the noble MaÃ±juÅrÄ«, extremely fortunate subjects such as Nyangben Tingdzin Zangpo<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> (who was sure to reach the state of Vajrasattva in that very life), and gurus abiding on the level of Buddhahood, such as PadmÄkara of Great Bliss, who was AmitÄbha of the Vajra Speech family appearing in the form of an accomplished awareness-holder.<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> At that time, when all interdependent circumstances for the world and its inhabitants were perfectly auspicious, because of the assembling of local deities such as the Twelve Tenma Goddesses<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> (who are actually the Twelve Mothers<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> of the <em>Cakrasaá¹vara Tantra</em> born among the worldly Menmo spirits), there were many accomplished yoginÄ«s, including the princess of MÃ¶n named Tashi Kyidren<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> and Shelkar Dorje Tso.<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> But the foremost among them, like the pinnacle of a victory banner, was Lady Yeshe Tsogyal,<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> who was born in the family of the king of Kharchen.<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> She was revered as Noble TÄrÄ, the universal monarch of the lotus and <em>karma</em> families, and she was considered to be none other than VajravÄrÄhÄ«, the mother of the victorious ones and the source from which all á¸ÄkinÄ«s, as numerous as the atoms of Mount Meru, emanate. The <em>Treasure Vase Containing the Essence of Great Bliss</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the heart of a lotus flower<br/>
[Arose the goddess TÄrÄ, swift and courageous.<br/>
In the wilderness of snowy mountains, she appears as a woman.<br/>
Outwardly, she is the sweet-voiced Tsogyal.<br/>
Inwardly, she is venerable TÄrÄ in actuality.]<br/>
Secretly, she is VajravÄrÄhÄ«.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also said in many other sources, such as Ratna Lingpa's<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a> <em>Three Cycles of Tsogyal</em><a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a> and the lord of victorious ones Dorje Tokme's<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> pure-vision cycle of <em>Bearing the Seal of Secrecy</em>.<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a> Not only that, it is also said in the <em>Precious Books of the Kadampa</em><a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a> that she was the consort of the immaculate guru<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a> and that she is the foremost among the á¸ÄkinÄ«s of Uá¸á¸iyÄna. Furthermore, she is none other than Secret Wisdom<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a> (who is also known by the names á¸ÄkinÄ« Kungamo and Nyida NgÃ¶drub<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a>). The Great Fifth Dalai Lama's <em>Bearing the Seal of Secrecy</em> says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the foremost among the á¸ÄkinÄ«s from the land of Uá¸á¸iyÄna.<br/>
I am Secret Wisdom and MandÄrava.<br/>
Here, in the land of Tibet, I am renowned as Kharchen Za,<br/>
And in CÄmara as Padma Skull-Garland's queen,<br/>
The preserver of immaculate bliss.<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many such quotations. It is said here that Princess MandÄrava is one with Secret Wisdom, which is also mentioned many times in the <em>Embodiment of the Guru's Wisdom.</em><a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a> The Great Omniscient One<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[25]</a> says in the <em>Khandro Yangtik</em>:<a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[26]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the palace in the land of Uá¸á¸iyÄna<br/>
Is the foremost of immeasurable á¸ÄkinÄ«s,<br/>
Yeshe Tsogyal...<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[27]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the cloud-banks blazing with á¸ÄkinÄ«s<br/>
You bring down a rain of ambrosia-like accomplishments.<br/>
You are the consort who pleases the Victorious One of Great Blissâ<br/>
Kharchen Tsogyal, I prostrate to you!<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[28]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quotation is in accordance with the previous one, and also with the earlier quotation in which it was shown that she is Secret Wisdom. The third line of the latter can be interpreted to show that everywhere she was the supreme and foremost queen of the Lotus King, in Uá¸á¸iyÄna, India, Tibet and CÄmara. Moreover, it is said in all the indisputable treasure texts that she is the consort of the Great Compassionate One, the Six-Syllable Goddess,<a href="#fn:29" id="fnref:29" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[29]</a> Secret Wisdom. <em>The Root Tantra of MaÃ±juÅrÄ«</em>, in the section on TÄrÄ, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goddess takes the female form<br/>
And arises, along with her ten powers, from compassion.<a href="#fn:30" id="fnref:30" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[30]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Illuminating Lamp,</em> the <em>Victorious Non-duality</em><a href="#fn:31" id="fnref:31" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[31]</a> is quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord of the World becomes the illusory goddess.<a href="#fn:32" id="fnref:32" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[32]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in actuality she is also one with MahÄmÄyÄ,<a href="#fn:33" id="fnref:33" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[33]</a> the mother of the king of the ÅÄkyas. The <em>Gaá¹á¸avyÅ«hasÅ«tra</em> says that MahÄmÄyÄ aspired to be the sole mother of all buddhas, wherever they arise, in a pure realm where the ground is ornamented with flowers.<a href="#fn:34" id="fnref:34" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[34]</a></p>
<p>Then, in the form of DhÄtviÅvarÄ« VajrayoginÄ« she made the request to the master Great Lotus,<a href="#fn:35" id="fnref:35" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[35]</a> who looks with compassion upon the disciples to be tamed in this land, to turn the Dharma wheel of the immeasurable teachings of Secret Mantra, and she gathered all his teachings. She then requested that immeasurable treasures, which cannot be disturbed or harmed by humans, non-humans or the elements, be concealed, so that the volumes of those teachings would never disappear.</p>
<p>In order that the continuity of blessings would not be interrupted, she made sure that the treasures were timely and in accordance with the karmic destinies of the respective rulers and subjects by sealing them with the aspiration &quot;May this treasure meet with destined and fortunate disciples!&quot; The preservation of the life-force of VajrayÄna teaching all comes down to her, as will be clear if you look at the concluding sections of all the individual treasure texts. In the prophecies of Ratna Lingpa's treasures, there is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the extremely profound, ultimate essentials:<br/>
Since Tibetans generally like new things,<br/>
And because of heartfelt compassion for beings of this degenerate age,<br/>
I filled the land with treasureâright, left, and centre.<br/>
I made the aspiration that they might meet with destined children.<br/>
[In future times people will fall into extremes of being either arrogant scholarsâintellectuals stuck on wordsâ<br/>
Or arrogant 'great meditators'.<br/>
They will think highly of themselves and dispute the treasures.<br/>
Nevertheless, it is the treasuresâprofound and yet complete, undefiled and exhaustiveâ<br/>
That will guide most Dharma practitioners of the degenerate age.<br/>
Through only a few spiritual instructions, individuals will certainly be liberated.<br/>
Therefore, if pure, fortunate ones whose karma is awakened<br/>
Remember death, they will practice the Dharma treasures.<br/>
And in one life the path of liberation will be attained.<br/>
Disciples, fortunate ones who have interest in the treasures in these degenerate times,<br/>
These days, just by seeing the face of the guru and making aspirations,<br/>
Everyone has a karmic connection, so rejoice!]<br/>
These words of mine are rarer than precious gold.<a href="#fn:36" id="fnref:36" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[36]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is her speech. Later, she opened the doors of the treasures and released their seals, as is illustrated by her direct bestowal of volumes of scriptures, such as the earth treasures she gave to Nyang Rinpoche<a href="#fn:37" id="fnref:37" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[37]</a> and the mind treasures she gave to Rigdzin Jigme Lingpa<a href="#fn:38" id="fnref:38" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[38]</a> (and there are many more, including the Great Omniscient [Longchenpa]'s <em>Vision of the Net of Light</em><a href="#fn:39" id="fnref:39" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[39]</a> or Minling Terchen's<a href="#fn:40" id="fnref:40" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[40]</a> great treasures). This alone is her most important enlightened activity, which she carries out directly or indirectly, as is most appropriate. There is another reason for this. A scripture of the Vinaya says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wife of a householder said to her lord: &quot;Husband! If you seek wealth and I hoard it, before long our riches will increase.&quot;<a href="#fn:41" id="fnref:41" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[41]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As this tells us, it is a womanâs role to maintain the basis of wealth on a mundane level. Similarly, when dhÄraá¹Ä«s, which hold and preserve the Dharma, manifest as deities in the mantra vehicle, they adopt the forms of goddesses, and therefore we speak of 'retainers' (<em>dhÄriá¹Ä«</em>) or 'maá¹á¸alas of retainers'.<a href="#fn:42" id="fnref:42" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[42]</a> Therefore, the entrustment of the instructions section of the <em>Extensive Illusory Net</em> says:<a href="#fn:43" id="fnref:43" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[43]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>...entrusted to the consorts.<a href="#fn:44" id="fnref:44" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[44]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, although the blessings of all supremely accomplished awareness-holders are equally great, there are demonstrable differences in terms of transmission.<a href="#fn:45" id="fnref:45" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[45]</a> Thus, since she laid the foundation for the treasure lineages as a means to prevent the Dharma treasury of Secret Mantra from dissipating, this goddess of the vajra-incantation<a href="#fn:46" id="fnref:46" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[46]</a> was even more excellent and sublime than any other awareness-holder among the lord and subjects.<a href="#fn:47" id="fnref:47" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[47]</a></p>
<p>This name and manifestation of 'Kharchen Za' are widely taught for those who cannot see the utterly pure form of VajravÄrÄhÄ«, as she is easier to practice than VÄrÄhÄ«'s other forms. For the beings of Tibet in particular, she deliberately manifested in a particular paternal and maternal lineage and in a particular guise. As <em>Bearing the Seal</em> [<em>of Secrecy</em>] says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the peak of the glorious mountain of CÄmara,<br/>
I[, Yeshe Tsogyal,] will strive to protect the people of the Tibet's Pugyal Empire. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the centre of a city in Sri Lanka, not far from this land of JambudvÄ«pa, there is a special awareness-holder pure realm. There, Yeshe Tsogyal remains in the coarse body that she had during her lifetime, until she discards it, to watch over the beings of Tibet in the past, present, and future. For us Tibetans, therefore, accomplishment through this practice is much more readily attainable than it is for others, such as the Chinese, Mongolians and the like. Furthermore, she came for the purpose of taking care of beings with the supreme enlightened activity of the swift path of the secret, Unsurpassed Tantra, and her blessings are thus exceptionally strong and powerful.</p>
<p>There are many practice manuals of the guru, which are specifically designed for Tibet and in which she appears as the chief goddess of the maá¹á¸ala (such as Guru ChÃ¶wang's<a href="#fn:48" id="fnref:48" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[48]</a> and Ratna Lingpa's <em>Embodiment of the Guru's Secrets</em>,<a href="#fn:49" id="fnref:49" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[49]</a> Dorje Lingpa's<a href="#fn:50" id="fnref:50" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[50]</a> <em>KadÃ¼</em>,<a href="#fn:51" id="fnref:51" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[51]</a> Drikung's <em>Profound Wisdom</em>,<a href="#fn:52" id="fnref:52" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[52]</a> and the extensive and medium <em>Sphere of Liberation</em><a href="#fn:53" id="fnref:53" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[53]</a>).<a href="#fn:54" id="fnref:54" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[54]</a> There are also many sÄdhanas that focus on the Lady herself in particular, like timely letters sent to guide the diligent practitioners of Tibet.</p>
<p>There are so many treasures made especially for this time that have already been revealed, such as the general treasures of substances, Dharma, wrathful mantras, and in particular the sÄdhanas of the Lady herself, and <em>kutsab</em>s,<a href="#fn:55" id="fnref:55" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[55]</a> letters, treasure texts, and accomplishment substances. And it can be known from authentic sources, such as the treasure prophecies, that there are many more yet to be revealed. These are all magnificent signs indicating that if you are able to diligently practice the mantras and sÄdhanas of this Lady of yoginÄ«s, then even in these evil times, the blessings are immediate and undiminished, and the attainments will come without hindrance.</p>
<p>When she was a Tibetan woman with a supreme body of the lotus [family] and lived in the centre of the snowy mountains of Tibet, she was called Yeshe Tsogyal. When she manifests as the queen of awareness-holders in the Palace of Lotus Light on the Glorious Mountain, she is called DhÄtviÅvarÄ«, Queen of Great Bliss. When she is subduing the <em>rÄká¹£asa</em>s in their lands which surround the Glorious Mountain, she is called the á¸ÄkinÄ« Blazing Blue Light.<a href="#fn:56" id="fnref:56" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[56]</a> In reality, however, these are all names applied to manifestations of the single body of Kharchen Za; they are all Tsogyal herself.</p>
<h3>The Perspective of the Practice Tradition</h3>
<p>In ChÃ¶wangâs <em>Crown Ornament</em> practice of Tsogyal,<a href="#fn:57" id="fnref:57" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[57]</a> the goddess is said to have the nature of TÄrÄ. Yet the tradition of how to practice that form is not mentioned. In Ratna Lingpa's <em>Three Cycles of Tsogyal</em>, the outer practice is Tsogyal, the inner TÄrÄ, and the secret is the Black Wrathful Lady,<a href="#fn:58" id="fnref:58" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[58]</a> and so each of the practices is done separately. In the Great Fifth's <em>Bearing the Seal</em> [<em>of Secrecy</em>], during the practice there is the tradition of the 'all-embodying jewel' where Tsogyal is practiced alone. When granting the empowerment, there is a way of transforming into the three of outer, inner and secret. In ChÃ¶je Lingpa's<a href="#fn:59" id="fnref:59" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[59]</a> treasures there is a way of practicing Yeshe Tsogyal as the Black Wrathful Lady.<a href="#fn:60" id="fnref:60" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[60]</a></p>
<p>Yet here we have her combined practice. During the approach phase, for the supreme, uncommon practice, she is 'combined' with VajravÄrÄhÄ«, who powerfully brings about the primordial wisdom of inconceivable luminosity. During the activities, she transforms and is combined with TÄrÄ, who swiftly accomplishes common activities, thus bringing about the attainment of varied activity without any obstacle. When receiving the empowerment, the outer, inner, and secret practices are combined, so this practice has the great quality of completing the empowerments for all three at once. The inner practice says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do the approach phase from within the mother of all-pervading space.<a href="#fn:61" id="fnref:61" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[61]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the empowerment manual says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through one ritual, the blessing [(the YoginÄ«),<a href="#fn:62" id="fnref:62" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[62]</a><br/>
Permission blessing (TÄrÄ),<br/>
And empowerment (VÄrÄhÄ«) are completed.] <a href="#fn:63" id="fnref:63" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[63]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the preceding has been explained on the basis that she is the queen of the lotus family. In this regard, the <em>Ritual for Guiding the Dead</em>, which is part of this practice, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>á¸ÄkinÄ« of the lotus family, queen of the wisdom of great bliss...<a href="#fn:64" id="fnref:64" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[64]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In two treasures of Nyang Ral Nyima Ãzer, the <em>Red</em> and the <em>Black VajravÄrÄhÄ«</em>,<a href="#fn:65" id="fnref:65" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[65]</a> and the <em>Heart-Essence of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s</em>,<a href="#fn:66" id="fnref:66" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[66]</a> Kharchen Za is considered to belong to the supreme transmission of HayagrÄ«va and VajravÄrÄhÄ« of the lotus family. And there are also many other texts that explain that she belongs to the lotus family. An AvalokiteÅvara longevity text from the treasure-revealer of Sha Uk, says:<a href="#fn:67" id="fnref:67" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[67]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if you accomplish other deities, you accomplish me.<br/>
In reality there are no divisions or bias in terms of good or bad,<br/>
Yet there are differences based on aspirations made in the past.<br/>
If you practice the lotus family, accomplishment will be swift.<br/>
Enlightened activity will flourish, and others' perception brought under control.<br/>
Adverse circumstances will not arise and the state of awakening will be near.<a href="#fn:68" id="fnref:68" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[68]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This appears to apply to both Padmasambhava and his consort. Most histories of the <em>Eight Great Maá¹á¸alas</em><a href="#fn:69" id="fnref:69" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[69]</a> list both the Precious Guru (among the eight awareness-holders of the noble land of India) and Tsogyal (among the eight awareness-holders of Tibet) as primary figures in the transmission of KÄ«la, Enlightened Activity. When the five families are condensed into three, the karma family is included within the lotus family. The colour of TÄrÄ's body and the nature of her implement, the <em>utpala</em> flower, are explained in the Conduct Tantra commentary by Buddhaguhya.<a href="#fn:70" id="fnref:70" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[70]</a> The Unsurpassed Tantra sections also include the logic of explaining the main goddess of the Amoghasiddhi family as TÄrÄ. I think it is excellent to consider this in relation the inner practice.</p>
<p>If you practice Secret Mantra in this country, which is the domain of activity of the Great Noble Compassionate One and is full of pernicious gods and demons, it is crucial to rely on such a powerful embodiment of two forms of activity, both wrathful elimination and caring guidance. It is in this spirit that I have recounted the history a little: to inspire confidence, not merely to tell a story.</p>
<h3>The Empowerment Ritual</h3>
<p>This empowerment is given according to the 'tradition of granting the blessing of the four empowerments', so it is vital that you should never grant it to someone who has not received the elaborate empowerments of either the <em>Peaceful and Wrathful Deities Who Purify the Lower Realms</em><a href="#fn:71" id="fnref:71" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[71]</a> or the <em>Awesome Ones' Assembly</em>.<a href="#fn:72" id="fnref:72" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[72]</a></p>
<p>As for the preparations, for the <em>sindÅ«ra</em> maá¹á¸ala you need a mirror made of bronze, [which is an alloy of tin and copper.] It must contain tin and copper because they represent the white and red elements, whose gathering and radiating brings about bliss. This is explained at length in the Indic texts. Moreover, although the treasure text itself<a href="#fn:73" id="fnref:73" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[73]</a> says that you must draw the seed-syllables of the five female buddhas, the self-initiation<a href="#fn:74" id="fnref:74" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[74]</a> says that you must arrange the syllables <em>tÄá¹</em> and <em>ha</em>, <em>ri</em>, <em>ni</em> and <em>sa.</em> I am not sure whether one has to choose, or whether the seed-syllables of the five female buddhas can be understood as in the self-initiation; this needs to be investigated.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that places the coils of joy in the four directions on the <em>dharmodaya.</em><a href="#fn:75" id="fnref:75" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[75]</a> Yet it does not say anywhere that [you must place coils of joy in] the four corners, and so I think it is best if all five coils of joy are placed in the centre of the <em>dharmodaya</em>. Everything else is clear in the text itself.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the main part of the empowerment there are no clear instructions on inviting the empowerment deities. When saying, &quot;Vajra of the sky, at this moment, grant it to me!&quot;<a href="#fn:76" id="fnref:76" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[76]</a> this is clearly also a prayer to the empowerment deities who abide in the sky, so in that instant you behold the maá¹á¸alas of the deities of the three seats<a href="#fn:77" id="fnref:77" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[77]</a> awaken and fill the sky. The Thus-Gone Ones<a href="#fn:78" id="fnref:78" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[78]</a> direct their wisdom minds and the female buddhas grant the empowerment with the water of the vase and so on, in the usual way. Then, imagine that the maá¹á¸ala's main female Buddha grants the empowerment with the skull-cup and the vase. I think perhaps this is appropriate, since it would accord with other texts of a similar type.</p>
<p>During the vase empowerment, place the skull-cup and vase on the recipientsâ heads and give them the water from the vase. Then place the vase back on the maá¹á¸ala.</p>
<p>During the secret empowerment, it is said, you visualize the ambrosia<a href="#fn:79" id="fnref:79" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[79]</a> as the bodhicitta of the master and his consort and then distribute it. In this regard, a stream of bodhicitta flows from the master's body, enters the consort's crown, flows through her body, and gathers in her secret lotus. Then, you imagine that you receive this directly on your tongue. Or you can imagine that you receive the ambrosia<a href="#fn:80" id="fnref:80" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[80]</a> that arises from the sexual union of the master and his consort. I don't see any contradiction between these options. At that time, you place the skull-cup and vase at the recipientâs throat and offer the ambrosia to drink.</p>
<p>During the third empowerment the students should generate the pride of being a heroic one<a href="#fn:81" id="fnref:81" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[81]</a> and transform into the ÄcÄrya, the lord of the family. When saying <em>jaá¸¥ hÅ«á¹ vaá¹ hoá¸¥</em>, the goddessâthe support for the empowermentâsits in the studentâs lap. The student then imagines engaging in union through the four <em>mudrÄ</em>s of embracing, binding, and so on. Place the <em>sindÅ«ra</em> maá¹á¸ala and the bell in their left hand. When saying <em>Äá¸¥ hoá¸¥ mahÄsukha</em>, the student imagines attaining the realization of the innate wisdom at the conclusion of the four joys which arise from the <em>mudrÄ</em>. Apply <em>sindÅ«ra</em> to the heart. The master should perform all this with only the left hand.</p>
<p>For the fourth empowerment, consider that you confer an introduction to the ultimate intent of the transcendent perfection of insight, the absolute in which the unsupported awareness that is the goal and destination of the illustrative innate wisdom merges into the all-pervading space of the three doors to liberation. Ring the bell aloft and direct the student to focus awareness on its sound.</p>
<p>When proclaiming the samayas,<a href="#fn:82" id="fnref:82" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[82]</a> it is good to mention that the best time for making offerings on the tenth day of the waning moon<a href="#fn:83" id="fnref:83" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[83]</a> is at night. You should also respect and honour young women, just as one of the ten actions of VÄrÄhÄ«<a href="#fn:84" id="fnref:84" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[84]</a> is to make offerings to young women extensively. Even if that is not possible, to avoid disparaging them and so on would fully accord with the requirement.</p>
<p>Of the three supreme empowerments, the substances for the first are taken from the space of Tsogyal herself. For the second, you place the seed-syllable of TÄrÄ in the centre of the <em>sindÅ«ra</em> maá¹á¸ala. For the third, there is the introduction to the absolute VajravÄrÄhÄ« of all-encompassing space. It is worth investigating whether it is appropriate to follow the saying at the end of the empowerment text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;â¦through one ritual, the blessingsâ¦&quot;<a href="#fn:85" id="fnref:85" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[85]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Main Part of the Practice Text</h3>
<p>Before taking refuge and arousing bodhicitta, you should dedicate the <em>torma</em><a href="#fn:86" id="fnref:86" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[86]</a> to the obstructing forces and establish the boundary. The accompanying liturgy should be taken from the male practice [of <em>Assembly of Awareness Holders</em>],<a href="#fn:87" id="fnref:87" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[87]</a> as it says in RatÃ¶n Jigme GawÃ©'s<a href="#fn:88" id="fnref:88" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[88]</a> commentary<a href="#fn:89" id="fnref:89" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[89]</a> and the arrangements for the activities by the lord of adepts.<a href="#fn:90" id="fnref:90" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[90]</a> The protection circle guards against obstacles throughout the entire main part of the sÄdhana, so you should know that it is preferable not to dissolve it until the conclusion.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the generation of the deity, there is the syllable <strong><em>Äá¸¥</em></strong>,<a href="#fn:91" id="fnref:91" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[91]</a> which represents blending the mind with the space of luminosity and emptiness. Out of that state, <strong>all appearances</strong>, meaning the outer vessel of the world, and <strong>all that exists,</strong> the inner inhabitants, living beings, are visualized clearly (and in the usual way) as the maá¹á¸ala of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s of infinite purity. What form does this take? For &quot;<strong>the palace is beyond cause and condition</strong>&quot; and what follows, visualize and meditate on the pure realm and body of Tsogyal of Great Bliss in particular. This should follow the instructions in the <em><a href="/tibetan-masters/jigme-lingpa/yumka-nyenyik">Recitation Manual</a></em> and the <em>Raá¹­ik</em> commentary.</p>
<p>This generation phase ritual assumes the perspective of practitioners of the very highest capacity. Its way of bringing birth, death and the bardos into the three <em>kÄya</em>s is more profound than other generation phases of Unexcelled [Yoga Tantras], and, unlike those other practices, it does not involve gradual meditation. Here the meditation is based on mere recollection of how the essence of the great emptiness of primordial purity abides. Then, instantly, one enters its self-radiance or clarity and vividness, which is the spontaneously perfect wheel of the support and the supported,<a href="#fn:92" id="fnref:92" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[92]</a> like the natural reflection of planets and stars in the clear surface of a lake. Furthermore, the cause for the ground to become the luminosity of the moment of death and at the time of the result to become the ultimate dharmakÄya is the non-conceptual space of the <em>essence</em>. The cause for the ground to increase in the bardo of dharmatÄ<a href="#fn:93" id="fnref:93" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[93]</a> and, at the time of the result, the cause for it to arise as the saá¹bhogakÄya endowed with the seven aspects [of union]<a href="#fn:94" id="fnref:94" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[94]</a> is the <em>nature,</em> the primordial wisdom of unceasing, radiant clarity. The cause for the ground to become the basis for the arising of the inexhaustible, manifold displays of confusion that follow the bardo of becoming and, at the time of the result, the cause for it to be purified as the nirmÄá¹akÄya and the enlightened activities is the <em>compassion</em>âthe play of awareness that arises in the form of dualistic grasping. These three are all completely present in a single instant of our present awareness. Therefore, if you can transform them into the utterly pure deity, mantra and primordial wisdom, none of the points of purity, perfection and ripening will be lacking. Investigation will confirm that no generation-phase ritual is more profound or more penetrating than one in which such transformation occurs. Also, &quot;<strong>the palace is beyond cause and condition</strong>&quot; means that all this arises spontaneously and is not generated based on the cause of a seed-syllable such as <em>bhrÅ«á¹</em> or conditions such as <em>viÅva viÅuddhe</em> and other such generation-mantras. This is explained in the <em>Raá¹­ik</em> commentary.</p>
<p>Concerning the palace, I have seen an old text, purportedly copied from another one written by Rangjung Dorje<a href="#fn:95" id="fnref:95" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[95]</a> himself, in which it is explained that &quot;in the maá¹á¸ala of the Female Practice there are no tympanums.&quot;<a href="#fn:96" id="fnref:96" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[96]</a> Nor are there any pillars, friezes, and the like. Therefore, the <em>Raá¹­ik</em> says, &quot;On the outside the form is completely round.&quot;</p>
<p>Viewed from the outside, it is round and made of red light wherever you look, like a tent of rainbows. The inner chamber, which is semicircular and red, has one <strong>entrance</strong> with porticos, side walls, and a trefoil aperture.<a href="#fn:97" id="fnref:97" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[97]</a> I feel that the complete shape of the inner portion is none other than this.</p>
<p><strong>The palace blazing with great bliss</strong>: inside the palace is a crossed <em>dharmodaya</em> which is white (greyish)<a href="#fn:98" id="fnref:98" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[98]</a> on the outside and red on the inside. It symbolizes the freedom from all characteristics: the conceptual elaborations of the eight extremes and the 'corners' of thought. It is the dharmakÄya, <strong>the single sphere</strong>,<a href="#fn:99" id="fnref:99" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[99]</a> the buddhas' city of great liberation. The palace is round. Its interior is red and half-moon-shaped, because the power of this dharmakÄya nature, which has ardent compassion as its self-radiance, draws embodied beings within and overwhelms them. It has one <strong>door</strong>, because it is the entrance that leads only to <strong>all-pervading space</strong> or emptiness. The <em>dharmodaya</em> has the nature of innate bliss. Its three corners symbolize the three doors of liberation (the <em>Chariot of Omniscience</em><a href="#fn:100" id="fnref:100" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[100]</a> says that this means beyond thoughts, objects and ignorance). Since it arises from the interdependence of method and insight (white and red) the outside is white and the inside red. It is open, because realization increases from the stage of aspirational practice all the way to the stage of Buddhahood. It is crossed, because space and primordial wisdom are indivisible. Its six corners are said to symbolize the conceptual distinctions<a href="#fn:101" id="fnref:101" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[101]</a>of the six primordial wisdoms. Furthermore, the outside of the palace mainly illustrates emptiness, while the <em>dharmodaya</em> represents bliss. Since these two are inseparable, I think that we can say that each possesses the purity of both bliss and emptiness entirely.</p>
<p><strong>The heart of a lotus</strong>: since she possesses the skilful means of great compassion, even though she remains in saá¹sÄra, she is not stained by its faults. This is symbolized by the lotus in full bloom. The <strong>sun-disk seat</strong> symbolizes the insight that overcomes all the darkness of ignorance.</p>
<p>Regarding the lines that begin, &quot;<strong>In the expanse of dharmakÄyaâ¦</strong>&quot;, just as it is said in the feast-gathering section: &quot;<strong>HÅ«á¹! The Unsurpassed</strong><a href="#fn:102" id="fnref:102" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[102]</a> <strong>and the other celestial realmsâ¦&quot;</strong>, the foremost of the hundred peaceful and wrathful deities who abide in the Unsurpassed is SamantabhadrÄ«. Of the yoginÄ«s of the sacred places, including the yoginÄ« Caá¹á¸Äká¹£Ä« and others, their basis for manifestation and the foremost of all those who dwell in the skies are VajravÄrÄhÄ« and Tsogyal. The former is the basis of manifestation, and the latter is the manifestation. Thus, the labels of the three <em>kÄya</em>s are applied. At all times during the recitation, you must generate the stable conviction that these three are indivisible. In this way, you must also remember that the deities arranged in the body maá¹á¸ala, which will be shown below, are all aspects of Tsogyal. The <em>Raá¹­ik</em> commentary says that only the dharmakÄya free from conceptual elaborations is SamantabhadrÄ«, and in the Unsurpassed she arises in a form body as VajravÄrÄhÄ«.</p>
<h3>The Purity of the Goddess' Form</h3>
<p>Her <strong>one face</strong> symbolises the fact that all phenomena are bound in the single sphere of the <em>bindu</em> of luminosity. Her <strong>two hands</strong> are compassion and insight. The <strong>red colour of her body</strong> illustrates that the purity of desire is the essence of the primordial wisdom of discernment, and that she belongs to the speech family. Her <strong>naked</strong>ness symbolizes that she is entirely free from the veil of the two obscurations and that fear is absent. Her two feet <strong>stand in the posture of equanimity</strong>, illustrating that she does not remain in the extremes of existence or peace. <strong>Yet</strong> she is <strong>ready to act</strong>, symbolising that she acts for the benefit of beings. Her <strong>passionate and smiling</strong> bearing shows how she delights in taming disciples by means of the path of passion. With her <strong>right hand</strong> she plays the <strong>skull</strong> <em>á¸Ämaru</em>, symbolizing that although saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a are mutually opposed, they merge as one within suchness.<a href="#fn:103" id="fnref:103" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[103]</a> Nyang Ral Nyima Ãzer's VajravÄrÄhÄ« treasure says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The skull is the 'bliss-sustainer'.<a href="#fn:104" id="fnref:104" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[104]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Embodiment of the Guru's Wisdom</em> says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the <em>á¸Ämaru</em> (many treasure texts explain that the skull-drum is an indispensable accomplishment substance of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s and extol its greatness), it resounds with the Dharma of the unsurpassed, Great Vehicle, which rouses all sentient beings from the sleep of ignorance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dharma sound of the Great Vehicle is the profound, natural sound of innate bliss and emptiness. The <em>Commentary on the Embodiment of the Guru's Wisdom</em> explains how this summons and magnetizes á¸ÄkinÄ«s based on a quote from the <em>Bindu of Union</em>.<a href="#fn:105" id="fnref:105" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[105]</a> There are many other ways of explaining this, but here, as the <em>Raá¹­ik</em> tells us, it is to invoke the compassion of the master, the lord of the families. The melodious sound of the transcendent perfection of insight, which was explained above, invokes the heart of the guru and pleases him.</p>
<p><strong>In her left hand she holds a hooked knife, resting on her hip</strong>. This knife cuts through the web of thoughts and brings them under control through the extraordinary clear seeing of the transcendent perfection of insight. Because of the pride and charm of the bliss that arises from being victorious in the battle with conceptual thoughts, <strong>her bearing is imposing and graceful</strong>. <strong>Her expanded bhaga</strong> symbolizes that she has opened, through bliss, the maá¹á¸ala of the three doors of liberationâthe absoluteâand that she gives supreme joy to the fortunate. <strong>Her swollen breasts</strong> illustrate how she provides an excellent, inexhaustible stream of attainments, arising from the full maturity of primordial wisdom. She appears in the form of a sixteen-year-old youth, since she possesses the innate youthfulness of perfecting the sixteen joys. <strong>She is adorned with youthful ornaments</strong> and <strong>jewels</strong> which are known as ornaments for children <strong>and wears a garland</strong> made of <strong>flowers</strong> that reaches her secret place. <strong>The six bone ornaments</strong> illustrate that she has perfected the six transcendent perfections, common and uncommon. As she has undone the knots of grasping, her <strong>hair is plaited</strong>.</p>
<p>As for her three eyes, <strong>her central eye</strong> is located in the spot between her eyebrows. It resembles the right eye (including its eyebrow) if it had been raised.<a href="#fn:106" id="fnref:106" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[106]</a> This eye, the dharmakÄya eye of the essence, <strong>gazes into</strong> the <strong>all-pervading space</strong> of inner luminosity. Through gazing at the Lord of the Family's mind-heart, they become one in the expanse of wisdom and merge in the all-pervading space of primordial wisdom. <strong>Her</strong> left, the <strong>saá¹bhogakÄya eye</strong> of the nature, gazes straight ahead at the pure realm of the five primordial wisdoms. This causes clarity and appearance to mature into the <em>kÄya</em>s and wisdoms and perfects the strength of the enlightened activity of taming beings. With her right eye, the <strong>nirmÄá¹akÄya eye</strong> of compassion, she gazes down upon the beings of the <strong>three realms</strong> and magnetizes those beings to be tamed. Relying mostly on the <em>Raá¹­ik</em>, I have explained all this in a way that is easy to understand.<a href="#fn:107" id="fnref:107" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[107]</a></p>
<h3>The Body Maá¹á¸ala</h3>
<p><strong>In her body the maá¹á¸alas of all the classes of tantra are perfectly complete.</strong> The <em>Raá¹­ik</em> explains that they are complete in two ways: as the body maá¹á¸ala and 'in the manner of a guest'. 'In the manner of a guest' means that the deities of Action Tantra, Conduct Tantra, Yoga Tantra, and so on are also present. The body maá¹á¸ala is introduced briefly with this line and then explained elaborately in what follows. The coarse body maá¹á¸ala of the aggregates and so on is based on the <em>Anuyoga</em> practice of <em>Tsokchen DÃ¼pa</em>, and the subtle body maá¹á¸ala of the channels and elements is based on the Mother Tantra of <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>. The great Omniscient One said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ordinary minds of beings and the wisdom minds of the victorious ones<br/>
Are distinguished by their awareness being either slight or vast.<a href="#fn:108" id="fnref:108" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[108]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that beings and buddhas are distinguished according to whether their awareness of luminosity is tightly bound by the ordinary aggregates, elements, faculties, and objects, or not at all. Generally, it is taught that phenomena such as the aggregates and elements are purified by the body maá¹á¸ala of the Peaceful and Wrathful Deities. The self-initiation <em>Empowerment's Ocean of Significance</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The aggregates, elements and sense sources<br/>
Are the maá¹á¸alas of the three seats,<br/>
Yet they are bound by obscurations of the channels, winds and vital essences.<a href="#fn:109" id="fnref:109" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[109]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like this, the saá¹sÄric channels, winds and vital essences maintain the life-force channel of the impure aggregates and so on, like the trunk of a tree,<a href="#fn:110" id="fnref:110" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[110]</a> and it is the body maá¹á¸ala of the twenty-four yoginÄ«s of the sacred lands in particular that blesses them and thereby controls them or makes them pliable. The other points of the [Peaceful Deities] are easy to understand.</p>
<p>Our text merely mentions that we should visualize the deities of the wrathful maá¹á¸ala as present in the pores of the body, but the <em>Raá¹­ik</em> says that the <em>heruka</em>s of the five families and Mahottara<a href="#fn:111" id="fnref:111" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[111]</a> with his consort are in the skull-mansion of the brain. In the centre of a four-spoked wheel is Buddha <em>Heruka</em> with his consort; in his heart is Mahottara; in the East is <em>Vajra Heruka</em> and so on. All the deities are arranged like this, one by one. The doorkeepers and the <em>Ä«ÅvarÄ«</em>s of the sacred lands are visualized in the pores of the body; this is something that the Omniscient One himself said. Although all six <em>heruka</em>s are described as having three faces and six arms, it seems it would not be inappropriate to visualize them according to the concise <em>mudrÄ</em>.</p>
<p>As for the subtle body maá¹á¸ala, the twenty-four sacred places such as Pu[llÄ«ramalaya], JÄ[landhara], U[á¸á¸iyÄna] and A[rbuda]<a href="#fn:112" id="fnref:112" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[112]</a> are the twenty-four places within one's own body, such as in the head and the place between the eyebrows. <em>Clarifications on the Recitation Manual</em> says that you should meditate that the channels of each of these places transform into the twenty-four heroic ones such as Khaá¹á¸akapÄlin, and the elements transform into the twenty-four á¸ÄkinÄ«s.<a href="#fn:113" id="fnref:113" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[113]</a> Yet the <em>Chariot of Omniscience</em> says that the twenty-four channels such as 'Indivisible' and 'Subtle Form' are the sacred places,<a href="#fn:114" id="fnref:114" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[114]</a> and that they are the basis for the white elements, which are the heroic ones, and the red elements, which are the á¸ÄkinÄ«s. The latter are emphasized in the <em>Raá¹­ik</em>, but whatever you do is fine. Bear in mind that when the <em>Clarifications on the Recitation Manual</em> says '&quot;are completely transformed,&quot; this is a crucial point for the body maá¹á¸ala.</p>
<p>The <em>Clarifications on the Recitation Manual</em> mentions &quot;the generation phase of the great consummate nature,&quot; and the root text<a href="#fn:115" id="fnref:115" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[115]</a> says &quot;<strong>the consummate deities of the three seats of completeness</strong>.&quot; This is referred to as the profound generation phase where spontaneous presence arises as appearance and emptiness. Yet this does not accord with our approach here, where we are <em>only</em> concerned with the naturally established body maá¹á¸ala where the ground of accomplishment is unaltered.<a href="#fn:116" id="fnref:116" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[116]</a></p>
<h3>The Retinue</h3>
<p>&quot;<strong>She is surrounded by a vast assembly of hundreds of thousands of á¸ÄkinÄ«s.</strong>&quot; The <em>Raá¹­ik</em> says: &quot;In the four directions are the white [á¸ÄkinÄ«s] of Great Bliss, the yellow of Accomplishing Aims, the red of Uttering Sound, and Accomplishing All.&quot; In the spaces in-between are the BuddhakrodhÄ«s and in the intermediate directions are the samaya-á¸ÄkinÄ«s and others, each with their own retinue of hundreds of thousands. The <em>Clarifications on the Recitation Manual</em> mentions many more: &quot;There are hundreds of thousands of great <em>gandharava</em>sâ¦&quot; The ones mentioned previously [in the <em>Raá¹­ik</em>] are the deities inside the palace. The ones mentioned in the latter quotation [from the <em>Clarifications on the Recitation Manual</em>] are all placed in the surroundings outside: in the <em>Eight Great Maá¹á¸alas: Assembly of the Bliss Gone</em><a href="#fn:117" id="fnref:117" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[117]</a> it is explained that each of the ten directional protectors (who abide in courtyards of the Dharma protectors) is accompanied by hundreds of thousands of á¸ÄkinÄ«s of each family, and moreover, there are hundreds of thousands of demonesses, Menmo, flesh-eaters, and the like. Also, there are hundreds of thousands of those called 'Seven-Leaved Tree Spirits'.<a href="#fn:118" id="fnref:118" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[118]</a> All these are referred to in the concise expression &quot;<strong>hundreds of thousands of á¸ÄkinÄ«s</strong>&quot;. The term &quot;<strong>vast</strong>&quot; here refers to a retinue of limitless, inexpressible numbers of heroic ones and á¸ÄkinÄ«s.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Family</h3>
<p>As a sign that the Lord of the Family is engaged in Pema TÃ¶treng Tsalâs secret conduct of great bliss, he has the <em>heruka</em> accoutrements, such as a topknot, bone ornaments and a tiger-skirt. &quot;<strong>From the guru's body, a stream of ambrosia...</strong>&quot; He has the nature of skilful means, the syllable <em>haá¹</em>âthe wheel of great blissâand his body are immaculately [white] in colour like the resplendent moon.<a href="#fn:119" id="fnref:119" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[119]</a> He appears youthful, since he has attained the body of immortality that incorporates all the vital essences of existence and peace. His two hands symbolize skilful means and wisdom. He plays the <em>á¸Ämaru</em> which resounds with the sound of bliss and emptiness; it invokes all the victorious ones, who then fill the sky, and causes primordial wisdom to descend. His two legs are in the posture of equanimity, signifying that he does not remain in the extremes of existence or peace.</p>
<p>Regarding the outer and inner maá¹á¸alas, those with superior faculties will understand their meaning; those with intermediate faculties will take aspiration as the path; and those with lesser faculties will merely aim to visualize the main deity and the wisdom deity. This is what the <em>Recitation Manual</em> says. The final approach is also appropriate, because if we adapt the lines of the <em>Glorious Assembly,</em> it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although an inconceivable host of deities is radiated and absorbed,<br/>
They are the magical manifestations of the chief goddess alone.<br/>
If you attain mastery over the life-force of Tsogyal,<br/>
The circle of deities will arise without effort.<a href="#fn:120" id="fnref:120" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[120]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Manual of Concealed Instructions</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as the most precious thing for a human being is consciousness,<br/>
For all the forms of the symbolic <em>mudrÄ</em> of the deity,<br/>
It is the majestic wisdom being,<a href="#fn:121" id="fnref:121" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[121]</a><br/>
Visualized with extreme clarity and stabilityâthis is crucial.<a href="#fn:122" id="fnref:122" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[122]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I were to write about the invitation, offerings, and praise as well, the text would become overlong, so I shall refrain from doing so.</p>
<h3>Mantra Recitation</h3>
<p>In general, VajravÄrÄhÄ« does not always have a sow face [on her head]. Yet here the wisdom being is described as 'two-faced', so let me elaborate a little on the nature of the sow face by presenting some quotations, then offering an analysis. A commentary on Nyang Ral Nyima Ãzer's <em>Golden Practice of the á¸ÄkinÄ«</em> treasure text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The consort VajravÄrÄhÄ«: the heroine's sow on her head represents few thoughts and great strength. In this way it symbolizes the absence of good or bad thoughts about saá¹sÄra, and great strength that cuts saá¹sÄra at the root.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, the <em>Secret Practice of VÄrÄhÄ«</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the sow face, since a sow is quite ignorant and does not differentiate between clean and dirty, this symbolizes purifying ignorance in its own place rather than abandoning it. Through the yogic conduct of compassionate wisdom, destructive emotions and conceptual thoughts are cut at the root.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The practice <em>Embodiment of All the Families of VÄrÄhÄ«</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since she lacks thoughts of clean and unclean, a black sow face protrudes on her head.<br/>
Since ultimate reality is unchanging, it is black.<br/>
Compassionately acting for the benefit of beings, it blissfully looks out, situated on her right side.<br/>
Eliminating and taming all the wicked ones, it grunts.<br/>
It terrifies all such obstacle-makers as arrogant demons, enemies, and obstructing forces.<br/>
Having brought herself under control, she binds the attendants into servitude.<br/>
Having brought under control the five classes of wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s and others who are beyond this world and all the á¸ÄkinÄ«s of the eight charnel grounds who are not beyond this world, she is surrounded by a retinue of servants and attendants. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the <em>Commentary of the Oral Lineage of the Black Wrathful Lady</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The statement &quot;on her crown is a sow face, abiding in space&quot; means the following. In the middle of her locks there emerges a black <em>sow face</em>, gazing upwards. This symbolizes that she always <em>abides in</em> thought-free, <em>space</em>-like wisdom. Also, when the sow face grunts upwards it magnetizes all the formless realms; when it grunts straight ahead, the form realms; and when it grunts downwards, the desire realms. Grunting in the four directions, it magnetizes the á¸ÄkinÄ«s of the four families.<a href="#fn:123" id="fnref:123" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[123]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many other texts that explain these points, but in short, this is the symbolic <em>mudrÄ</em> of the ultimate luminosity, beyond thoughts and unchanging. Her colour is dark blue, since reality, which is naturally arising, cannot itself be changed by anything, yet it 'colours' the world and all beings with the freedom of conceptual elaborations. Her wrathful face is relative purity, and her sow face is absolute purity. In her right hand she holds a curved knife that cuts through the three poisons. Her left hand holds a skull-cup filled with blood which symbolizes her enjoyment in the continuity of great bliss. Since she has bound all phenomena in bliss her right leg is bent with her heel pointing towards her <em>bhaga</em>. With her outstretched left leg of insight she stands on a lotus, sun, and corpse, holding down the three crucial points of the essence, nature, and compassion. The bone ornaments are as explained before. She has three eyes that see the three times. In the cradle of her left arm she holds a <em>khaá¹­vÄá¹ga</em>, illustrating the indivisibility of skilful means and wisdom.</p>
<p>In her heart is a red coil of joy, its four parts coiled anti-clockwise. In its centre is a syllable <em>vaá¹</em> around which the root mantra is arranged. Besides this, the <em>Recitation Manual</em> does not explicitly say that the mantra turns like a firebrand. The <em>Raá¹­ik</em> says that you &quot;focus your attention on the mantra garland arranged anti-clockwise.&quot; The practice text says, '<strong>â¦encircled by the mantra garland; it revolves</strong>'. I wonder whether it would not be inappropriate to explain that in addition to the anticlockwise arrangement this is merely a way of explaining how each syllable is emphasized. This requires some further investigation.</p>
<p>Visualize clearly that the whole mantra garland at your heart, especially the life-force syllable, glows with a mass of light rays, as bright as a hundred suns, and unwaveringly focus your awareness on that. Through the condition of the mantra recitation, it blazes with extraordinary, majestic brilliance. The stages of visualizing clearly all the outer and inner maá¹á¸alas of á¸ÄkinÄ«s, like the sun shining on a mirror, are not explicitly mentioned in the <em>Recitation Manual</em> or <em>The</em> [<em>Raá¹­ik</em>] <em>Commentary</em>. Yet this enriches the meaning of the line &quot;<strong>Encircled by the mantra garland; it revolves, emitting light rays that</strong>...&quot; Through this you will swiftly gain powerful abilities and be brought closer to accomplishment. Thus, it is excellent to explain these supplementary crucial points. Many writings, such as the treasures of Nyang Ral Nyima Ãzer, say that the most important, special activity of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s is awakening wisdom. Here too, there is an emphasis on the visualization in which the Lord of the family's blessings is gathered. Furthermore, you must know that your appearance in the ravishingly beautiful form of the á¸ÄkinÄ«, the melodious tunes of the mantras, the sound of the <em>á¸Ämaru</em>, and her amorous disposition all function like the iron hook of magnetizing to invoke the guruâs wisdom mind. Remember, too, the points from <em>The Application of Mindfulness</em>: &quot;[Visualizing yourself in this manner] makes you a suitable vessel for empowermentâ¦&quot;<a href="#fn:124" id="fnref:124" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[124]</a></p>
<p>In particular, the stages of the visualization are as follows. The light-rays from the mantra garland exit through the crown of the á¸ÄkinÄ«'s head. They touch the Lord of the familyâs heart, and radiate further rays of light, which collect the accomplishments of all the buddhas. These then dissolve into the life-force syllable <em>vaá¹</em> at your heart, and so on, according to the stages of visualisation for accomplishing twofold benefit described in the <em>Recitation Manual</em>. Then, a stream of blissful ambrosia, white as moonlight and with the nature of the vajra-like awakened body, speech, mind, and wisdom, emerges from the guru's body. It enters the crown of oneâs head, bringing a <em>joy</em> that purifies the impurities of the channels, wind-energies, and vital essences that generate the perception of the body as ordinary. As the primordial wisdom of the vajra body dawns in oneâs mind, it blesses the body as the vajra body. When the ambrosia descends to the level of the throat, it generates <em>supreme joy</em>, purifying the stains of the vital essences and wind-energies that bring about confused speech. You experience the primordial wisdom of vajra speech and speech is blessed as vajra speech. Likewise, at the heart, through <em>special joy</em> the vital essences of the mind are purified, and the primordial wisdom of vajra mind is born. Below the naval, through <em>innate joy</em> the stains of the all-ground and the bliss of emission are purified. Your three doors are blessed as vajra wisdom and you imagine that, through the four joys, you experience the wisdom of the four empowerments or the wisdom of the four vajras. The main point here is the visualization of radiating and reabsorbing.</p>
<p>Regarding how the wisdom of the fourth empowerment, which comes about through the skilful means of innate joy, is experienced, or how that wisdom is applied, the <em>Sphere of Liberation</em> empowerment says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The innate joy at the end of the third empowerment is akin to blankness or oblivion.<a href="#fn:125" id="fnref:125" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[125]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the earlier part of the innate joy, the stain of being intoxicated by, or attached to, the experience of bliss is not yet purified, so one cannot lay bare the awareness of primordial purity. Yet during the latter part, those stains are purifiedâthe aspect of awareness awakens as clarity, and realization of carefree, spacious freedom dawns. Furthermore, the <em>Chariot of Omniscience</em> says that unless you can abide in innate [joy] for a long time and unless it is stable, you will not be able to distinguish the earlier and latter parts.<a href="#fn:126" id="fnref:126" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[126]</a> The degree of solidity and stability in your experience of innate joy will determine the extent to which you can lay bare and stabilize the aspect of clear, pure, refined awareness.</p>
<h3>The Meaning of the Mantra</h3>
<p>The <em>Tip of the Vajra</em> explains the syllable <strong>oá¹</strong> as &quot;the mantra that holds the jewel&quot; and &quot;the provider of glory and wealth&quot;,<a href="#fn:127" id="fnref:127" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[127]</a> and there are other such explanations. Here, however, it will suffice to understand it as the spearhead of the mantra and bestower of the supreme. <strong>Padmo-yoginÄ«</strong> refers to the lotus yoginÄ«. She appears everywhere in all the realms of the ten directions, innumerable and beyond the imagination, for those beings who are to be tamed through the Unsurpassable Vehicle of Yoga, in the form of a fine woman who has mastered the sixty-four arts of passion. She manifests in such forms that by seeing her beauty, hearing her songs, smelling the fragrance of her <em>utpala</em> flower, kissing her honey-like lower lip, or caressing her lotus, one's mind will be overcome with strong passion. Nobody can resist her. This approach is countless times faster than following the path free of desire and the vehicle of the levels and transcendent perfections, but it is no different from the actions of Samantabhadra that lead to unsurpassable, perfect awakening. If you remove all the habitual tendencies of transference, you will always be, as it says further on in our text: <strong>Unchanging great blissâVajrayoginÄ«</strong>. She is of one taste with unchanging bliss and emptiness, and she does not waver for a second from the supreme yoga that is likened to a lotus which remains in the water yet is never stained by its defects. <strong>JÃ±Äna-vÄrÄhÄ«</strong> means the wisdom sow. All thoughts will firstly blaze, then waver, and finally stabilize,<a href="#fn:128" id="fnref:128" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[128]</a> before being consumed by the indestructible essence at the centre of your heart and transformed into luminous, inconceivable wisdom. This is said in the feast-gathering songs of the Lord Guru,<a href="#fn:129" id="fnref:129" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[129]</a> and I have already explained this elaborately above. As for <strong>HÅ«á¹,</strong> <em>Tip of the Vajra</em> says: &quot;it eliminates...&quot;,<a href="#fn:130" id="fnref:130" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[130]</a> yet here it is the heart-essence that invokes the wisdom mind for the sake of accomplishment. The way to append this with the general life-force mantra of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s of the three places is found in <em>Turning Back the Summons: The Marvellous Appearance</em>.<a href="#fn:131" id="fnref:131" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[131]</a> But even here, where the mantra is not so adjoined, the main deity and the wisdom being include the vital forces of all those á¸ÄkinÄ«s, and thus these twelve syllables constitute the mantra of all their vital forces, with nothing lacking.</p>
<p>Before the liturgical arrangement was compiled, the treasure text contained the following lines immediately after the root mantra:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The crucial point is to rest in meditative equipoise on the nature of reality, in which there is neither granting nor receiving of the royal vase empowerment. There is no need to rely on a vast number of practices of the generation and completion phasesâthrough this practice alone, you will reach accomplishment.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Raá¹­ik</em> explains that these five lines show the benefit and that they are easy to understand. Yet, as it might seem perfunctory to repeat here that it is &quot;easy to understand&quot;, I shall explain a little. Earlier, it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The primordial wisdom of the four empowerments is experienced.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This includes the wisdom of the fourth empowerment, or awareness, which, when it becomes stable causes all the phenomena that are its self-manifestation or self-expression to be transformed into whatever one wishes, impervious to any condition or circumstance. This is what it means to gain the primordial kingdom or dominion, and it is referred to as being empowered with sovereignty.</p>
<p>Many texts of the empowerment of the dynamic power of awareness relate this to the analogy of a royal heir who wanders abroad and is brought back to the capital, which makes it extremely clear. This explanation applies only to the temporary mode of appearance. In reality, no matter how much the 'prince' wanders about in the radiance of awareness, the dualistic play of wandering is like a dream which never takes place outside the sleeping state. In a similar way, since one never leaves the primordial kingdom, it is <strong>the nature of reality, in which there is neither granting nor receiving</strong>. Even though there is neither granting nor receiving, still one speaks of 'granting empowerment'. As the <em>Great Life and Liberation</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When from within the all-pervading space of the naturally arisen luminosityâthe royal vase empowermentâwhich is of one taste with the great primordial wisdom of the three secrets of all the buddhas, where there is neither granting nor receiving, the propensity fully awakens, then...<a href="#fn:132" id="fnref:132" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[132]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This illustrates how through this alone supreme mind treasures arise. </p>
<p>This is the most important point in the root text of the completion phase for this teaching. Even if you cannot assimilate the meaning directly, by at least training to the best of your ability through aspirational practice, it is important that you set in place the right circumstances for the realization of the mind-direct transmission to be transferred and stabilize the continuum of empowerments and blessing. Focusing the mind on the form of the deity is the awakened body, the recitation is awakened speech, and this is the luminosity of the awakened mind, the yoga of suchness. Thus, this also becomes the gradual path of the three vajras.</p>
<h3>Straightforward Explanation of How to Traverse the Complete Path</h3>
<p>First, generate the main deity and the body maá¹á¸ala and merge the <em>samaya</em>- and wisdom beings. Focus as much as you can on a clear appearance and generate stable pride. In the knowledge that deity and mantra are indivisible, recite the mantra. The light-rays of the mantra invoke the <em>heruka-</em>guru's wisdom mind and gather the ambrosia of bodhicitta. Putting effort into the inner feast-gathering and receiving the empowerments brings swift blessings to the common aggregates and elements and the channels, wind-energies and vital essences. The primordial wisdom of the three blazings will arise: your body will become blissful, your speech powerful, and realization will dawn in your mind. </p>
<p>This development occurs gradually beginning with the most subtle aspects. As you eliminate distraction and meditate diligently, the strength [of primordial wisdom] develops. At some point there arises a bliss that comes from having moved the channels and elements in actuality. And if that matures further, the wisdom of the 'example innate [joy]', the culmination of the four joys, will arise. When that itself is fully stabilized, you will see the naked face of the primordial wisdom of the fourth empowerment, the natural state of the Great Perfection, and obtain the life-force of the absolute VajravÄrÄhÄ«. </p>
<p>During this process, first you meditate solely based on aspirations and concepts. You train in considering the appearance aspect of the maá¹á¸ala of the deities and the palace to be the radiance of spontaneously present awareness. At first you will obtain merely a fraction of the realization of great bliss. Gradually, you will be able to blend the appearance of the deities with bliss and become habituated with bliss arising as the deities. When you continuously do this, so that it becomes stable, you will eventually nail down the wheels of deity and mantra upon awareness itself. Then, the appearance of objects dissolves into the deity and the deity merges with awareness. As the practice text of <em>Glorious Assembly</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When planting the nail that brings together<br/>
Deity, appearance, and <em>dharmatÄ</em> as one,<br/>
One's own appearance is awakened in the ultimate Akaniá¹£á¹­haâ<br/>
There is no doubt about this.<a href="#fn:133" id="fnref:133" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[133]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many stages for this, based on depth, scope and stability. Yet finally, when appearance and mind pervade everywhere and merge with the environment, then it is as our practice text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...<strong>the supreme sign is to possess an unwavering wisdom mind.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You won't be disturbed by any situation of happiness or suffering, and you'll obtain a limitless capacity to overpower your own and others' thoughts and perceptions. At that time, through the power of meditating on the yoga of the á¸ÄkinÄ«, you will be able to merge your own perception with the appearance of purity, and you will even be able to see the primordially present pure realms of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s of the three <em>kÄya</em>s. You will swiftly obtain the power to meet not only the hosts of mantra-born and field-born á¸ÄkinÄ«s, but also the innate Lady. Through their power you will purify the stains of the channels, elements and wind-energies. The aspiration prayer <em>Entering the City of Omniscience</em> says: &quot;In the scriptural transmission Anuyoga...etc.&quot;<a href="#fn:134" id="fnref:134" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[134]</a> This means that you will master the ordinary accomplishments up to and including Akaniá¹£á¹­ha, and as the supreme accomplishment you will be able to travel to the city of the three <em>kÄya</em>s with their seven branches. With that in mind, our text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There is no need to rely on a vast number of practices of the generation and completion phasesâthrough this practice alone, you will reach accomplishment.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Glorious Ocean of á¸Äkas</em> tantra says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Encounters with yoginÄ«s<br/>
Depend on merit and are rarely won.<br/>
[The great joy of such interactions,<br/>
When experienced, deceives death.]<br/>
Worshipping yoginÄ«s<br/>
Is thus what yogis must do.<br/>
The level of a great vajra-holder<br/>
Is obtained by pleasing them.<a href="#fn:135" id="fnref:135" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[135]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible that some will find this explanation, in which I have not dealt with the generation and perfection phases separately, somewhat vague and unclear. Yet I have expressed myself based on our own tradition, according to which the generation and completion phases are traversed in union, unlike in other explanations.</p>
<p>As for how one meets yoginÄ«s, there are many different ways, such as meeting them in one's own house, while roaming about in the great sacred places of accomplishment, in experiences or in dreams. When a practitioner has the pride of the goddess, then the form of the goddess grants the bliss of union as follows. <em>The Lady's Play of the Union of Blessing</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I, a girl, am going to CÄmaradvÄ«pa.<br/>
You, boy, generate the pride of the hero HayagrÄ«va.<a href="#fn:136" id="fnref:136" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[136]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rigdzin Pema TrinlÃ©<a href="#fn:137" id="fnref:137" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[137]</a> comments that first you must generate yourself and the front visualization as Yeshe Tsogyal and do the mantra recitation and so on. Then, when the self-initiation says, &quot;Son, you are a heroic one...&quot; you immediately transform yourself into HayagrÄ«va (whom you are primordially) and engage in desire. The <em>Two Segments</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a <em>mudrÄ</em> and a <em>mudrÄ</em>, with these two,<br/>
How can you attain the accomplishment of <em>mudrÄ</em>?<a href="#fn:138" id="fnref:138" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[138]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meaning of this is as follows. Just as when the consort recites the mantra to bless the vajra, likewise the <em>mantrin</em>, in the form of the hero, is then blessed in turn by Tsogyal herself, and then they engage in sexual union. During the bestowal of the empowerment, the text says, &quot;Imagine in this way.&quot; The guru should explain precisely how to meditate on the stages of visualization. The blessing arises based on the teacher and the disciple being of one mind, and not just the student meditating alone. Information concerning the third empowerment and intimate conduct<a href="#fn:139" id="fnref:139" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[139]</a> can be found in many other sources.</p>
<h3>Body Maá¹á¸ala of the Peaceful and Wrathful Deities</h3>
<p>It is said that Samantabhadra with consort and VajravÄrÄhÄ« are not like vessels placed one within another. They are wisdom forms and therefore neither merge together nor obstruct and block one another; they are manifestations of meditative concentration, beyond the imagination. Still, I think that for a beginner it is most convenient to meditate with the wisdom being in the heart (which looks like an upturned tent) and the body maá¹á¸ala of the Peaceful and Wrathful Deities in the open space of the chest and the heart, as <em>Commentary on the Embodiment of the Guru's Wisdom</em> explains.<a href="#fn:140" id="fnref:140" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[140]</a> There is also a tradition that comes from the Omniscient [Jigme Lingpa], according to which the ritual of <em>The Peaceful and Wrathful Deities Who Empty the Lower Realms</em> is combined with this practice text.<a href="#fn:141" id="fnref:141" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[141]</a> This is why the body maá¹á¸ala of this [practice] is so arranged. You can consider that this deity [i.e., the Queen of Great Bliss,] and this mantra are also the quintessence<a href="#fn:142" id="fnref:142" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[142]</a> of <em>Emptying the Hells from their Very Depths</em>.<a href="#fn:143" id="fnref:143" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[143]</a> You need to understand that this is especially profound for the purpose of purifying concepts, obscurations, impairments, and breakages and restoring and healing the samayas.</p>
<h3>The Recitation</h3>
<p><em>Clarifications on the Recitation Manual</em> explains how to meditate on the mantra garland in the heart of Samantabhadra and so on. It does not explain the colour of the life-force [syllable <em>a</em>] and the mantra garland, but I think blue would be appropriate. The mantra syllables up to and including <em>mahÄsukha</em> relate to the peaceful deities and those from <em>rulu</em> onwards relate to the wrathful ones. This is the general recitation of <em>The SÅ«tra Gathering of the Great Assembly</em>,<a href="#fn:144" id="fnref:144" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[144]</a> which explains that, even though one recites this mantra alone 700,000 times, this completes the essential approach phase. The main text of the <em>SÅ«tra</em> mentions a common and an uncommon recitation. For the first, one recites the mantras of each of the peaceful and wrathful deities individually. For the latter, one performs the recitation in the knowledge that appearance and existence have the nature of the three primordially perfected maá¹á¸alas.<a href="#fn:145" id="fnref:145" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[145]</a> Understand that this is the approach of recitation for the all-embodying mantra[, which is also followed in our practice text].</p>
<h3>The Meaning of the Mantra</h3>
<p><strong>Oá¹</strong> incorporates the five wisdoms. <strong>Guhya-jÃ±Äna</strong> means secret wisdom. <strong>Bodhicitta</strong> is the mind set on awakening. <strong>MahÄsukha</strong> means great bliss. The <em>Raá¹­ik</em> does not explain the meaning of <strong>rulu rulu</strong> other than to connect it to the deities. Other texts say that <strong>ru</strong> refers to <em>rujo</em>,<a href="#fn:146" id="fnref:146" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[146]</a> which means 'destroy!' <strong>Lu</strong> refers to <em>lÅ«na</em>, which means 'cut!' These are said twice, as is the case for <em>chindha chindha</em>. The great accomplishment of the <em>Eight Great Maá¹á¸alas</em> says that <strong>ru</strong> refers to great desire (<em>rÄga</em>). <strong>Lu</strong> refers to <em>lumbi</em>, the space of Samantabhadra's consort. <strong>Ru</strong> refers to <em>rajo</em>,<a href="#fn:147" id="fnref:147" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[147]</a> which means that emotions are brought under control. <strong>Lu</strong> represents <em>loka</em>, which means that the three realms are brought under control. <strong>HÅ«á¹</strong> signifies great joy, through which manifestations are dispatched. <strong>Bhyo</strong> means that the mundane is transformed from within all-pervading space. The last <strong>hÅ«á¹</strong> refers to precious, immeasurable qualities. <strong>Phaá¹­</strong> means arousing the great bliss of all-pervading space. There are many similar explanations.</p>
<h3>The Accomplishments</h3>
<p>The eight great accomplishments are attained in the following way. If you magnetize the hosts of yoginÄ«s they will directly confer the <em>siddhi</em> pills, eye-medicine, sword, and so on. The bliss that they grant through sexual union will lead directly to the attainment of the celestial realms and so on. The <em>Illusory Net</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Such is evidently the case. In this context, Lord Nyang [Ral Nyima Ãzer] was put on a jeweled palanquin by the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s and, to the accompaniment of the sound of a lute, carried to SukhÄvatÄ«. There he beheld the scenery of the realm for seven days before returning to our world. In the place where he descended a rain of flowers fell for all to see. Here it is also fitting to mention the history of how the Lord of Dharma Rinchen PÃ¼ntsok<a href="#fn:150" id="fnref:150" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[150]</a> and Trengpo TertÃ¶n [Sherab Ãzer]<a href="#fn:151" id="fnref:151" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[151]</a> were led by the á¸ÄkinÄ«s to the realm of Lotus Light and there met the Great Master [Padmasambhava].<a href="#fn:152" id="fnref:152" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[152]</a> Even if you do not complete the approach in this lifetime, then, as a vajra song of the Omniscient Jigme Lingpa himself says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though having taken an excellent location, empty and devoid of humans, as my fatherland,<br/>
If I am not able to imitate the life and liberation of the Great ChetsÃ¼n [Senge Wangchuk]<a href="#fn:153" id="fnref:153" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[153]</a><br/>
May I, forcefully focusing on the 'celestial middle path',<br/>
Be welcomed and escorted by Yeshe Tsogyal.<a href="#fn:154" id="fnref:154" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[154]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, remembering the practice of the threefold outlook<a href="#fn:155" id="fnref:155" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[155]</a> at the time of death will have the additional effect of causing VajrayoginÄ« to come in actuality to lead us to the realms of the awareness-holders. The <em>Recitation Manual</em> refers to additional minor accomplishments. This includes the three types of gathering: people during the day, á¸ÄkinÄ«s during the night, and sustenance every morning and evening. Of these, the main one is the gathering of á¸ÄkinÄ«s during the night. As the <em>Tantra of Glorious Vajraá¸Äka</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The women [and heroic ones] of this land<br/>
[Will grant accomplishment.]<br/>
Always active during the night,<br/>
Always gathering during the night.<br/>
Flying in the sky and other great accomplishments,<br/>
Difficult to obtain, will be granted.<a href="#fn:156" id="fnref:156" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[156]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the signs of accomplishment, most practice texts of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s emphasize those related to the magnetizing activities. Concerning the reason for such emphasis, a á¸ÄkinÄ« tantra says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through desire for women, beings are tamed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the <em>Ornament of the Vajra Essence:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, through the embrace of those two<br/>
The classes of tantra are taught.<a href="#fn:157" id="fnref:157" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[157]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like this, all the wisdom goddesses revealed in the lower and higher classes of tantra are taught for the purpose of taking desire as the path. All the goddesses of the Unexcelled Yoga Tantras in particular arose solely for the purpose of granting practitioners innate bliss. All the deities, mantras, wisdom, awakened deeds and activities of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s are accomplished based on the yoga of bliss. The ultimate, secret point of magnetizing is the <em>samÄdhi</em> of bliss, and so if you gain proficiency in the approach and accomplishment of the á¸ÄkinÄ«, then even without intentionally making any effort you will naturally magnetize the world and its inhabitants. Merely by directing your focus you will be able to transform others' perceptions.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The instructions that explain how to apply the various activities can be found in other texts.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the inner practice. Among the collection of activities, the pacifying activities include the fifteenth, eighteenth, and other sections; enriching includes the first to the fourth and others; magnetizing includes the fifth and the tenth; and wrathful activity includes the thirteenth, fourteenth and others.<a href="#fn:158" id="fnref:158" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[158]</a> Thus, there are limitless activities which make all the particular activities of the four enlightened activities complete. As for these, it is well known that of the three roots, the root of enlightened activity is the á¸ÄkinÄ«. In particular, as I said before, since the venerable TÄrÄ is the supreme deity of activity, she is more sublime than others when it comes to accomplishing anything from the collection of activities.</p>
<p>I saw in a text of the lord of yogis Changchub Dorje's<a href="#fn:159" id="fnref:159" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[159]</a> personal students (who upheld his transmission) that after &quot;<em>padmo-yoginÄ«</em>&quot; they added only &quot;<em>tÄre tuttÄre ture svÄhÄ</em>&quot; and would recite it that way. Before these activity practices they would focus on the wisdom being as TÄrÄ of the Khadira Forest and recite her mantra several hundred thousand times, or as many times as necessary. In the breaks they would recite the <em>Twenty-One Verses of Homage</em> as much as possible and offer a feast-gathering. I think this is excellent. It is similar to the great crucial point of having a strong pride that, regardless of the activity, the samaya being has the nature of TÄrÄ. It is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final activity is that of making a fire offering.<a href="#fn:160" id="fnref:160" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[160]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And immediately after that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just like when [a knife], already sharp, still needs tempering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here [making a fire offering is just like] sharpening a knife; [it is good but] it is not indispensable, as in the practice tradition of the twenty-one activities from the <em>Adornment for the Wisdom of the Lord of NÄgas</em>.<a href="#fn:161" id="fnref:161" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[161]</a></p>
<h3>Feast Offering</h3>
<p>The main substances of the feast-offering are beef and alcohol. When blessing them, a hearth of three skulls contains the substances of <em>oá¹ Äá¸¥ hÅ«á¹</em>. As the wind blows from below, its causes the fire to blaze, through which [the syllables] melt and transform into the five meats and the five ambrosias. On top of the moon-cover is a five-pronged vajra. From the space in its centre light radiates out, inviting the wisdom ambrosia. It dissolves and transforms [the contents] into clouds of the ambrosia of sensual enjoyments. This is explained in the <em>Raá¹­ik</em>. Yet it is also appropriate to think that the substances transform into the five meats and the five ambrosias <em>based</em> on oá¹, Äá¸¥ and hÅ«á¹. Then the wind blows from below, causing the fire to melt them.<a href="#fn:162" id="fnref:162" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[162]</a> I think &quot;<strong>With oá¹ Äá¸¥ hÅ«á¹ they are transformed into ambrosia</strong>&quot; means that from the space in the centre of the vajra, light in the form of the three syllables invokes the ambrosia. In short, it is just as described in the activity manual of <em>The Principal Protectors.</em><a href="#fn:163" id="fnref:163" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[163]</a></p>
<p>During the invitation, the main deity is also invited, in addition to the á¸ÄkinÄ«s of the twenty-four sacred places together with their retinues, although this is not specified in the commentaries. This is proven by the lines: &quot;<strong>The Unsurpassed and the other celestial realms,</strong>&quot; and below with &quot;<strong>heroic ones and yoginÄ«s</strong>&quot;. When we apply these lines to the invitation of the feast-gathering, they indicate that the main deity and consort wisdom beings are invited from Akaniá¹£á¹­ha and the celestial realms. Concerning the main celestial realm, it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>And also CÄmaradvÄ«pa, the supreme island among islands.<br/>
In reality they are Akaniá¹£á¹­ha, the pure realm of great bliss,<br/>
Yet they appear as emanated celestial realms.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These three lines show that CÄmaradvÄ«pa, indivisible from Akaniá¹£á¹­ha, is an emanated celestial realm. According to the explanation of the <em>Raá¹­ik</em> it is the realm of the Glorious Mountain of Lotus Light. Although it is a terrestrial realm, it is called a celestial realm because the chief goddess of the celestial realms abides there in actuality and also because its qualities are equal to those of the pure celestial realms. For example, the eight sacred places of the wheel of mind are terrestrial, yet their deities are held to descend from the sky, and thus they are given the name 'celestial'.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the <em>Raá¹­ik</em> also says that of the twenty-four sacred places, the supreme place where the goddesses abide is Uá¸á¸iyÄna, as in: &quot;<strong>Lie the supremely sacred land of Uá¸á¸iyÄna</strong>&quot;. <em>The Great Turning Back the Summons</em>, in the section on the activity maá¹á¸ala, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main is Uá¸á¸iyÄna's Dhumathala, and surrounding it are...<a href="#fn:164" id="fnref:164" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[164]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we see that the other great sacred places are placed around it. From the luminous emanated realms of the half-nirmÄá¹akÄya<a href="#fn:165" id="fnref:165" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[165]</a> the four essential yoginÄ«s such as White Ladies of Great Bliss are invited. We can explain this based on this first line.</p>
<p>When the text of the outer feast-offering says, &quot;<strong>The crown of the head is JÄlandhara</strong>&quot;, you shouldn't regard those sacred lands and places as external, but as parts of your own body, such as the crown of your head. If you know that these are [your body's] nature and then offer the feast, through pleasing the external heroic ones and á¸ÄkinÄ«s, internally the defects and deteriorations of your channels and vital essences will be eliminated, and your qualities will increase; you will be skilled in means. For an explanation, we should turn to the small-lettered explanations in <em>Turning Back the Summons: The Marvellous Appearance</em>.<a href="#fn:166" id="fnref:166" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[166]</a> The same logic can be applied in relation to the subtle body maá¹á¸ala wherein we generate pride that the external great lands and the heroic ones and á¸ÄkinÄ«s who abide there are actually present and in relation to how enjoying the feast-offerings pleases and magnetizes the á¸ÄkinÄ«s of the sacred places and lands. You can also apply this to the visualization for the approach phase.</p>
<p>Starting with &quot;<strong>JÄlandhara</strong>â¦&quot;, the first set of eight belongs to the wheel of mind, in which the deities are blue in colour. The second set belongs to the wheel of speech, and these deities are red. The third set belongs to the wheel of the body, and these deities are white. All the heroic ones of these three sets have one face and four hands, the upper two holding a vajra and bell, the right lower hand holding a <em>á¸Ämaru</em> and the left a <em>khaá¹­vÄá¹ga</em>. They have a topknot and a shawl. The yoginÄ«s have one face and two hands, in which they hold a knife and a skull-cup, and their hair hangs loose. All of them have three eyes and wear bone ornaments. &quot;<strong>Heroic ones and yoginÄ«s</strong>&quot; refers to the twenty-four á¸ÄkinÄ«s with their consorts. &quot;<strong>á¸Äkas and á¸ÄkinÄ«s</strong>&quot; refers to their retinue. &quot;<strong>Your topknots</strong>&quot; describes the heroic ones and &quot;<strong>Your long tresses</strong>&quot; the á¸ÄkinÄ«s. This is explained in the [<em>Raá¹­ik</em>] commentary. It is important to have an elaborate explanation of the great sacred places and the heroic ones and yoginÄ«s, but this should be learned from the [<em>Raá¹­ik</em>] commentary and <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em> cycle, so I shall not write more here.</p>
<h3>The Covenant</h3>
<p>It is not specified to whom the covenant is proclaimed, but you should visualize the protectors of the Heart-Essence, especially those of this practice text, in the outer environment, like billowing clouds. As for the history, it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the offspring of the awareness-holders.
You are the family of those gods and demons.<a href="#fn:167" id="fnref:167" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[167]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are thus connected as friends, and entrust the activities.</p>
<h3>Tenma Goddesses</h3>
<p>At the end of the offering to the Tenma Goddesses the text says &quot;ma ma hriá¹ hriá¹...&quot; which is similar to the <em>Assembly of Awareness Holders</em> and is explained in the [<em>Raá¹­ik</em>] commentary.</p>
<p>Before that, regarding the ritual for the remainder offering, it used to be that while reciting &quot;peá¹&quot;, you would perform the blazing <em>mudrÄ</em> with a turn in front of your forehead. Now that is no longer done, however, which must indicate some error in the texts or a fault in the custom.</p>
<h3>The Horse Dance</h3>
<p>HayagrÄ«va's armies emanate from the <em>khaá¹­vÄá¹ga</em> of VajravÄrÄhÄ«. Visualize them singing and dancing. This is also said in the [<em>Raá¹­ik</em>] commentary.</p>
<p>I think the rest of the text follows the usual Secret [Mantra] tradition and can also be understood from what has been explained already, so I shall not elaborate further.</p>
<p><em>I, Jigme Tenpe Nyima, arranged this text, Lamp That Illuminates the Excellent Path of Great Bliss: A Guide to the Practice Text of the Female Awareness-Holder, the Queen of Great Bliss, as a reminder for myself and others and as a basis for further investigation. The scribe was ChÃ¶kyi Drakpa. May all be virtuous and auspicious! Do not teach this to those who have not received the highest empowerment. Sarva maá¹galaá¹!</em></p>

<p>The Tibetan term <em>zindri</em> (<em>zin bris</em>) literally means notes or memoranda. Here, since this text is more comprehensive than some examples of the genre, we have here followed the Padmakara Translation Group and translated the term as &quot;guide&quot;. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>The Tibetan phrase <em>rigdzin yumka</em> (<em>rig 'dzin yum ka</em>) is particularly difficult to translate into English. <em>Rigdzin</em> was originally used as the translation of the Sanskrit <em>vidyÄdhara</em>, which could refer to a winged spirit with magical powers or to a practitioner who has gained magical abilities through accomplishment in tantric practice. In Tibet, the term came to refer to an accomplished practitioner of the Great Perfection, who is able to maintain (hold or uphold) the state of <em>rigpa</em> or awareness. This latter sense is most applicable in modern Nyingma literature. Although the Tibetan term <em>rigdzin</em> can refer to males or females, the Sanskrit term <em>vidyÄdhara</em> is masculine and would need to be declined as <em>vidyÄdharÄ«</em> in its feminine form. This might prove confusing for a non-specialist reader. For these reasons, we have chosen to render the term here as &quot;awareness-holder&quot;. The term <em>Yumka</em> is in some cases perhaps better left untranslated. (It appears as either <em>yum ka</em> or <em>yum bka'</em> in Tibetan sources. In the Derge edition of Jigme Linga's collected writings, the spelling <em>ka</em> is more prevalent, but <em>bka'</em> occurs as well. In the <em>Tengyur Pedurma</em>, <em>yum ka</em> is not found but <em>yum bka'</em> occurs a couple of times in reference to <em>bde mchog yum bka' so bdun.</em>) In some cases, but particularly here in tandem with the word <em>rigdzin</em>, it simply denotes a female practice, as distinct from the male practice or Yabka. In <em>Contemplations on the Female Practice</em> (<em>yum ka'i dmigs skor</em>), for example, our author, the Third Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpe Nyima (<em>rdo grub chen 'jigs med bstan pa'i nyi ma</em>, 1865â1926) refers to the <em>Rigdzin DÃ¼pa</em> practice of the Longchen Nyingtik cycle as the male practice (<em>yab ka</em>) and the <em>Queen of Great Bliss</em> as its female practice (<em>yum ka</em>). The very first line of the text says <em>tshe ring ma rig 'dzin yab ka yum ka gang dang sbrel yang</em>. It is possible that the term originated as a name for the VajrayoginÄ« practices in which VajrayoginÄ« 'separated' from Cakrasaá¹vara to become a deity of her own. <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>To clarify this, both Tulku Dawa Rinpoche and Khenpo Sonam Tsewang (Namdroling) point out (oral communication, 19 August 2020) that the discussion here concerns the two traditions of the generation phase. First there is the common generation phase of Highest Yoga tantra, which is gradual. Second, there is the special approach of the Nyingma tradition where the generation phase and completion phase are practiced in union. Khenpo Sonam Tsewang points out that it is important to recall the following section here: &quot;This generation phase ritual assumes the perspective of practitioners of the very highest capacity. Its way of bringing birth, death and the bardos into the three kÄyas is more profound than other generation phases of Unexcelled [Yoga Tantras], and, unlike those other practices, it does not involve gradual meditation. Here the meditation is based on mere recollection of how the essence of the great emptiness of primordial purity abides. Then, instantly, one enters its self-radiance or clarity and vividness, which is the spontaneously perfect wheel of the support and the supported, like the natural reflection of planets and stars in the clear surface of a lake.&quot; <a href="#fnref:116" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>This story is related in the latterâs biography: &quot;At Zingpa Taggo Sherab Ozer wrote many short treatises clarifying the teachings of his own treasure, the Sphere of Liberation, and it was here that he apparently organized his treasure's teaching and obtained its full realization. Sources tell us that while he was performing the treasure's practice, he was again granted the vision of a á¸ÄkinÄ« who invited him to visit Padmasambhava's Pure Land, the Copper-Colored Mountain where he could receive the Guru's teachings. The á¸ÄkinÄ« gave him the flesh of a man who had been Brahman during seven lives. After some hesitation, he finally ate this reputed magical substance, and by its power he was able to fly in the sky and eventually reached the realm of Padmasambhava. There he met him in his form of great bliss, in union with his consort and he received directly from him empowerments and precepts. According to sources this vision lasted for one month. He was finally told by the á¸ÄkinÄ«s to remember his Tibetan disciples and act according to his former wishes as a bodhisattva. The vision ended like a dream.&quot; Marc Henri Deroche, <em>Sherab Ozer</em>. <a href="#fnref:152" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
