	<h2>Elucidating the Body Maá¹á¸ala</h2>
<h3>Clarifications on the Recitation Manual of the Female Practice of the Queen of Great Bliss</h3>
<p><strong><em>by Jigme Lingpa</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Homage to the venerable VajrayoginÄ«!</em></p>
<p>Herein is contained a supplementary text that will remove all doubts concerning the <em>Recitation Manual</em><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> of the á¸ÄkinÄ« Queen of Great Bliss, the utterly profound practice of the female awareness-holder. </p>
<p>Generally in the Mantra Vehicle, the path consists of two stages: the generation phase and the completion phase. This is in order to purify the impure appearances of the world and its inhabitants as well as our confused attachment to them. As for the support, the vessel that is the world; as well as the supported, the essence that is all beings, there is nothing that is not made of the five elements. The outer elements are the five of earth, water, fire, wind, and space; the inner elements are the five of flesh, blood, warmth, breath, and consciousness. You must understand that their essence is the natural purity of the five female buddhas, just as in the statement âEarth and water are BuddhalocanÄ [and MÄmakÄ«â¦]â.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> The empty spaces in the netherworld, terrestrial world and celestial world are known as the three realms of existence. You should also know that they are naturally awakened as the pure realms of the awakened ones. </p>
<p>In particular, the aggregates, elements and sense sources; and the faculties, objects and eight consciousnesses are what appear to us as impure sentient beings. Through the profound generation phase, which includes the objects of purification and the results of purification, you will unmistakably know them to have the nature of the deities. You will know the essence of purity, the nature of reality. When you stabilize this clear appearance taken as the path, it is called the 'generation phase of the great consummate natureâ.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> </p>
<p>Now, what are the objects of purification and what are the results of purification? The objects of purification are the stains. This refers to the five aggregates and five elements that initially arise from the all-ground consciousness and the defiled consciousness, and also to the collection of consciousnesses that are defined as the sense sources (including the five faculties) that are the result of dominant conditions and objective conditions. These are mutually connected as object and subject. The result of purification is the arising in the form of deities such as the blessed, glorious Samantabhadra, who is the self-cognizing king of awareness and the embodiment of infinite maá¹á¸alas. As the <em>Immaculate Confession Tantra</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the secret all-ground is purified within all-pervading space, the mind naturally arises as the self-cognizing king of awareness, the father of the buddhas of the three timesâ¦ <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mind is the dominant condition because it is the agent that generates confusion. If you realize that it lacks true nature youâll know it to be the ultimate Samantabhadra of the natural condition, the self-cognizant king of awareness.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> </p>
<p>The term <em>dharma</em> has many meanings, yet here it refers to the objective condition, which is the element of mind, [i.e., the object]. Although this could apply to anything with characteristics in saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a, on this occasion it refers to all that appears as the relative once it is brought within the all-pervading space that is free from conceptual elaborationâthe absolute truth of the nature of reality, which arises as the mother who generates all maá¹á¸alas. It is therefore given the name SamantabhadrÄ, the acted-upon object.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a></p>
<p>Secondly, although [the deities] remain in the dharmakÄya, all-pervading space, in order to illustrate the union of appearance and emptiness, they are shown to have aspects such as a face and hands. It is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Utter purity of action and actor, mind and its object;<br/>
 I pay homage to Samantabhadra and his consort!<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, to illustrate the five aggregates, it is said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the absolute, beingsâ aggregate of consciousness is naturally pure. That is the essence of all the enlightened minds of the Thus Gone Ones. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>From here, continuing up to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I pay homage to the blessed, glorious VajrÄká¹£obhya!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this, the characteristics of the objects of purification and the results of purification are explained. If you analyse this, you will also be able to understand the visualizations for the deities of the body maá¹á¸ala. Still, [to render this clearly], Samantabhadra is in the mudrÄ of meditative equipoise and his consort is in the mudrÄ of âhands folded together in <em>dharmodaya</em>â. The buddhas of the five families hold in their right hand their respective sign and in their left, a bell. The consorts hold a bell in their right hand and in their left, their respective sign. Their colours are also determined by their family. To show the meaning of this, our own text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At her heart, the expanse of the glorious knot,<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a><br/>
Are the unfabricated, naturally arisen, completely perfect deities.<br/>
At the centre of a five-spoked wheel<br/>
Is the pure nature of the all-ground consciousness, mind and phenomena:<br/>
The all-pervading awareness is Samantabhadra.<br/>
In union with his consort SamantabhadrÄ, they are appearance and emptiness indivisible.<br/>
On the five spokes are the deities of pure form, feeling, perception,<br/>
Formation and consciousness:<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is gradually explained how the colour of the form of Vairocana, the purity of the aggregate of form, is white, and so on. Intelligent people might notice that there are minor discrepancies in the commentaries on the tantras, yet in our own tradition we should rely on the <em>Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Directions</em><a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> commentary on the <em>Illusory Net</em>,<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> which is the basis for the hundred peaceful and wrathful deities. If you do not realize the deitiesâ objects of purification and results of purification through this kind of generation phase, you might achieve a clear appearance, but still be deluded, which would be no different from seeing an ordinary templeâyou wonât understand the crucial points of how to swiftly traverse the path based on the Mantra Vehicleâs path of skilful means. </p>
<h3>The Twenty-Four Sacred Places</h3>
<p>Furthermore, on the outer level, in this world of JambudvÄ«pa there are the twenty-four places where the heroic ones and á¸ÄkinÄ«s naturally gather. The <em>Cakrasaá¹vara Tantra</em> says:<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In KulutÄ<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> and Maru,<br/>
In Sindhu and Nagara,<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a><br/>
In Suvará¹advÄ«pa and SaurÄá¹£á¹­ra,<br/>
In Gá¹hadevatÄ and PretapurÄ«,<br/>
In HimÄlaya and KÄÃ±ci,<br/>
In LampÄka and Kaliá¹ga,<br/>
In KoÅala and TriÅakuni,<br/>
In KÄmarÅ«pa and Oá¸ra,<br/>
In MÄlava, DevÄ«koá¹­a,<br/>
RÄmeÅvara, and GodÄvarÄ«,<br/>
And in Arbuda, Uá¸á¸iyÄna,<br/>
JÄlandhara, PullÄ«ramalaya, and so on.<br/>
The girls of these places are yoginÄ«s<br/>
Who are indivisible<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a> from the heroic ones.<br/>
They all have amorous forms<br/>
And are engaged through the power of mind. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar lists are found in other tantras, but fearing verbosity, I shall leave it at this. As regards these places, they are entirely present internally, within our own body, as shown in a line in our practice text: âThe crown of the head isâ¦â. Those placesâ channels are completely transformed into heroic ones and their elements are completely transformed into yoginÄ«s, each with their own names and in union. This is shown explicitly in the mother tantra of <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>, in chapter forty-one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Six YoginÄ«s are in KulutÄ,<br/>
And the Mothers are in the land of Maru.<br/>
The LÄmÄs are in the land of Sindhu,<br/>
And Ladies of the families are in Nagara.<br/>
In LampÄka and SaurÄá¹£á¹­ra are<br/>
The goddesses of the families.<br/>
In PretapurÄ« is MahÄkÄlÄ<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a><br/>
With the á¸ÄkinÄ« RÅ«pinÄ«. </p>
<p>At the HimÄlayan mountains and KÄÃ±ci,<br/>
In the regions of PaÃ±cÄla and Kaliá¹ga,<br/>
The householder goddesses who uphold yogic discipline,<br/>
And SabÄlikÄ, are said to be. </p>
<p>At KoÅala are the female meat-eaters.<br/>
At PretapurÄ« those who eat the great flesh,<br/>
The vajraá¸ÄkinÄ«s are at SthÅ«leÅvara.<br/>
At TriÅakuni are the Khaá¹á¸arohÄs,<br/>
And also at PullÄ«ramalaya.<br/>
On the golden mountain there are twenty-one thousand women<br/>
Born in the Meshachen family. </p>
<p>Whatever others there are,<br/>
They are all part of the circle of á¸ÄkinÄ«s<br/>
Of the glorious Herukaâ<br/>
They are the Ladies of the maá¹á¸ala<br/>
Of the glorious Heruka, the great churner. </p>
<p>These twenty-four á¸ÄkinÄ«s are pervasively present<br/>
In everything animate and inanimate of the three worlds<br/>
And in all sentient beings.<br/>
This samaya of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s<br/>
Is to meditate on these emanations.<br/>
Meditation and so forth, anything that is done,<br/>
Will be brought to perfection on this earth. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, as this explains, mantra is accomplished through samaya and aspiration. Once you gain certainty that the inner twenty-four places have the nature of the chief goddesses, this will be of immeasurable benefit when it comes to generating inconceivable cities of heroic ones and á¸ÄkinÄ«s through aspiration. The same text also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a mantrika remains always in meditative equipoise<br/>
And in the night<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> wears the clothing of the sky,<br/>
Whether male or âleftâ,<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a><br/>
All yoginÄ«s and heroic ones will be pleased. </p>
<p>If the offering of the mudrÄ of dance<br/>
Is always offered to the Self-Arisen One,<br/>
Then everything without exception is accomplishedâ<br/>
Youâll be fully engaged in the worship of the left.<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should know that âleftâ here relates to gender and refers to the gathering of á¸ÄkinÄ«s, yet it can also be understood as a mental disposition.<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a> Similarly the vast retinues of hundreds of thousands of á¸ÄkinÄ«s is an inclusive category. The <em>Collected Tantras of the Early Translation School</em> contains the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of great gandharvÄ«s,<br/>
Hundreds of thousands of great kumbhÄá¹á¸Ä«s,<br/>
Hundreds of thousands of great brÄhmÄ«s... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are others too, but I shall not list them all. In a similar vein, regarding the residence of the wisdom being, other tantras say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the heart is KÄÃ±ci.<br/>
Memory is HimÄlaya. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each text thus has its own way of applying the purity. Here, it is not that Samantabhadra and his consort at the heart are transformed into VajravÄrÄhÄ«. You need to abandon negative thoughts such as thinking that VajravÄrÄhÄ« is in the heart of Samantabhadra and his consort; and clinging to imputations of such conceptual thoughts as putting one thing inside something else, or one thing touching something else, or thinking that they would mutually obstruct one another. Rather, you need to meditate clearly on the completely perfect deities, who are the radiance of the natural, unfabricated state. In the expanse of light at the level of the heart of the chief goddess, meditate on the wisdom deity VajravÄrÄhÄ« in an especially clear manner and focus your awareness without wavering. Then, imagine light rays radiating out and gathering in and so on, as described in the <em>Recitation Manual</em>. This is to be understood from the spoken teachings and has the seal of the extraordinary oral tradition. Nevertheless, when doing the recitation of the body maá¹á¸ala, meditate that in the heart of Samantabhadra and consort, within a casket of the union of the sun and moon, is the life-force syllable <em>a</em> (<span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">à½¨</span>) surrounded by the mantra garland. </p>
<p><em>Palding JetsÃ¼n Drung, who has the great fortune of having met the profound and swift path and is diligently applying the sacred teachings and practices, sent a messenger from afar urging me to write down some quintessential pith instructions. In the past I made many mistakes by releasing the seal of these sacred words to numerous individuals who didnât even practise and who simply plundered them. Still, I have only ever explained these things with a pure motivation. Therefore, á¸ÄkinÄ« Dharma custodians, I beg you to consider that and forgive me. Please clear away all errors that reduce the blessing of this Dharma and obscure the great accomplishment, transforming them into great purity! This was written at the glorious Sanctuary of Lotus Light (Pema Ã Ling).</em><a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a> </p>

<p>For translations of passages from the <em>Cakrasaá¹vara Tantra</em> and Sanskrit spellings, David Gray, <em>The Cakrasamvara Tantra</em> (New York: American Institute of Buddhist Studies, 2007); and Sugiki, 'The Structure and Traditions of the Systems of Holy Sites in Buddhist Samvara Cycle and Its Related Scriptural Cycles in Early Medieval South Asia' have been very helpful. The <em>Cakrasaá¹vara Tantra</em> was translated into Tibetan by PadmÄkara and Rinchen Zangpo (<em>rin chen bzang po</em>; 958â1055); that translation was then revised at least twice. The revision currently accepted as canonical (the one found in the Derge Kangyur) was made by PrajÃ±ÄkÄ«rti and Marpa Dowa (or Mardo) ChÃ¶kyi Wangchuk (<em>mar pa do ba chos kyi dbang phyug</em>; ca. 1042-ca. 1136); another was made by SumatikÄ«rti and LocÄna LodrÃ¶ Drak (<em>mal gyo Lo tsÄ ba blo gros grags pa</em>; 11th century). Gray comments that the SumatikÄ«rti revision (the <em>phug brag</em>) is âof great significance as it often provides alternate readings, some (but not all) of which accord more closely with the surviving Sanskritâ (Gray, <em>The Cakrasamvara Tantra</em>, 145.). To make matters more complicated, however, Jigme Lingpa uses a different version from the <em>phug brag</em> that Gray has used. Jigme Lingpaâs version corresponds most closely to another revision, also attributed to SumatikÄ«rti and LocÄna LodrÃ¶ Drak (BDRC W2DB54922), although even this is not a complete match. For example, Jigme Lingpaâs text has <em>yi dwags</em> where W2DB54922 has <em>ka+tya che</em>, and elsewhere has <em>sha chen za</em> where W2DB54922 has <em>de bzhin du</em>. <a href="#fnref:12" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Sugiki (p. 532) has KulatÄ, but this spelling does not seem to be attested in any Tibetan text. <a href="#fnref:13" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:14">
<p>Gray and Sugiki have Nagara. This spelling is also found in the commentaries by Vajrapani (W1PD95844, p. 1061) and Tsongkhapa (W20510, p. 248). <a href="#fnref:14" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Kambala comments in his '<em>khor lo sdom paâi dka' âgrel sgrub paâi thabs kyi gleng gzhi</em> that this means sexual union (<em>snyoms par âjugs paâo</em>). Vol. 8: 991. <a href="#fnref:15" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>The following section is increasingly obscure and it is not possible to completely reconcile the Tibetan with Grayâs translation based on the Sanskrit. The translation is therefore provisional.  <a href="#fnref:16" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:17">
<p>All versions of Jigme Lingpaâs text read <em>mtshan ma</em> (sign/mark), yet this must be a mistake for <em>mtshan mo</em> (night), which is to be found in all editions of the tantra. <a href="#fnref:17" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Tsongkhapa comments that âleftâ here refers to a woman.

<li id="fn:19">
<p>These are the final verses of chapter 41. Grayâs translation is as follows: [If] one is always heteropraxical, naked, and equipoised at night, [then] all heroes and yoginis, who are born from the hero, are delighted. The self-emergent worship should be performed with offerings of gesture and dance. Everything is achieved without exception by means of the worship of the left.
