<h3>A Commentary on the Difficult Points of the Ritual of the Great Compassionate One, Natural Liberation of Suffering</h3>
<p><strong><em>by Jigme Lingpa</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>With your perfect vision you behold all beings,<br/>
Unceasingly watching over them<br/>
Through the corner of your eyesâ<br/>
To you, all pay homage!</em> </p>
<p>Here, there follows a commentary on the difficult points of <a href="/tibetan-masters/jigme-lingpa/dukngal-rangdrol-sadhana">the ritual of the Great Compassionate One, Natural Liberation of Suffering</a>.</p>
<h3>I. The Preliminaries</h3>
<h4>1. Taking Refuge</h4>
<p>In general, <strong>in this</strong> beginningless and <strong>never-ending cycle of saá¹sÄra,</strong> whose <strong>nature</strong> is the truth of <strong>suffering, I and all other beings helplessly roam about.</strong> So we must take refuge, yet the way to take refuge here is not the limited, selfish form that involves seeking peace and happiness for oneself alone. Instead, with the motivation of a great being, we wish to bring all sentient beings to the level of buddhahood. <strong>From the depths of</strong> our <strong>heart and with utmost longing</strong>, remembering that he knows and cares for us, we resolutely <strong>take refuge</strong> until we reach the heart of enlightenment <strong>in the embodiment of the Three Jewelsâthe supremely noble Lord of Compassion.</strong> His body is the saá¹gha, his speech the Dharma, and his mind the Buddha. He is utterly sublime and supreme among noble ones.</p>
<h4>2. Arousing Bodhicitta</h4>
<p>For the sake of supreme awakening we must first train in that which is similar to arousing bodhicitta. Thus, contemplate that among <strong>all sentient beings</strong> there is none who has not been oneâs own father or mother. And, right now, those <strong>beings of the six classes</strong> who have been <strong>your very own parents</strong> experience suffering in their respective realms, and they accumulate the causes for future suffering. Therefore they are <strong>the objects of my compassion.</strong> They still <strong>do not recognize</strong> <strong>the nature of their minds</strong>, their buddha nature. They have no opportunity to find liberation but instead <strong>act out of delusion.</strong> Meditate on the four <strong>immeasurables of</strong> loving-kindness, the wish to benefit beings, compassion, the wish to free beings from suffering, joy, the wish to place beings in happiness, and equanimity, through which benefit is enacted equally. With that in mind, carry the extraordinary load of great <strong>compassion</strong>. With your mind absorbed in these four abodes of Brahma, <strong>arouse</strong> the <strong>bodhicitta</strong> of <strong>aspiration</strong>âthe one-pointed wish that you will <strong>set</strong> all <strong>beings</strong> <strong>on the path</strong> of great <strong>awakening</strong>âand actionâwhich is what actually benefits. After you have meditated with great fervour on these two forms of relative bodhicitta, leave your mind to rest on the meaning of suchnessâthat is what is called <strong>absolute bodhicitta.</strong></p>
<h4>3. Seven-Branch Offering</h4>
<p>The seven-branch offering is comparable to gathering the accumulations for three uncountable aeons. Multiplying your body to create ten trillion emanations, <strong>in</strong> immense <strong>devotion pay homage to all sources of refuge</strong> who abide <strong>throughout the three times</strong>âpast, present and future. <strong>Make</strong> unsurpassable offerings, condensed into <strong>outer, inner and secret offerings</strong>. The <strong>non-virtuous deeds</strong> consisting of the three actions of the body, four of speech and three of the mind, as well as inherent and proscribed misdeeds, <strong>I openly acknowledge and confess</strong> with tremendous regret and by means of the four antidotal strengths. <strong>I rejoice in all</strong> my own and othersâ actions that are <strong>virtuous</strong>. <strong>I urge</strong> all the buddhas and bodhisattvas <strong>to turn the wheel of Dharma</strong> <strong>and request</strong> them <strong>to remain here</strong> and not pass into nirvÄá¹a. In order to <strong>dedicate all roots of virtue to enlightenment</strong> and focus on the benefit of others, I aspire <strong>that all beings may attain the level of the Noble One</strong>!</p>
<h4>4. Offering the Torma to Obstructing Forces</h4>
<p>This is like taming demons during the night. ÄªÅvaraá¸¥, the lord of the desire realm, and all those within his retinue and the classes of spirits create obstacles to the attainment of awakening. Therefore, as a remedy that will subdue them, imagine that from <strong>hrÄ«á¸¥</strong>, you transform <strong>into the form of the Mighty Lotus</strong> HayagrÄ«va, the sight of whom overwhelms <strong>all those who lead us astray</strong>. He is the <strong>great destroyer</strong> of demons and obstructing forces. He is perfectly visualized as in a single instant. Give the command with the three lines that begin, '<strong>Obstructing forces and misleading spirits, listen!</strong>'. Then threaten and torment them with the three lines that begin, '<strong>If you dare disobey</strong>'. Finally, expel them to the far side of the ocean with <strong>the mantra of the four hÅ«á¹s</strong>.</p>
<h4>5. The Protection Circle</h4>
<p>On the level of relative truth, meditate on the samÄdhi of the <strong>vajra tent</strong>: all the confused perceptions of <strong>appearance and existence</strong> are the vajra ground, fences, tents and canopies. Everything in between, down to the smallest particles, is filled with tiny vajras, so that even the wind cannot penetrate. The <strong>environment</strong> at which you grasp is the palace and the <strong>beings</strong> you conceptualize are the mudrÄs of the deities. Within the state of the <strong>three maá¹á¸alas,</strong> in which you realize that your body is the deity, your speech mantra and your mind the nature of reality, it is impossible for <strong>demons</strong> and <strong>obstructing forces</strong>âwho appear because of <strong>habitual tendencies</strong> and <strong>confusion</strong> (like mistaking a rope for a snake)âto exist.</p>
<p>On the level of absolute truth, you realize that the unborn essence is the dharmakÄya, the unceasing clarity the saá¹bhogakÄya and the unceasing radiance of appearances the nirmÄá¹akÄya. <strong>Within</strong> this <strong>state</strong> that does not waver from <strong>the three kÄyas</strong>, <strong>set the boundary</strong> of the absolute.</p>
<h4>6. Descent of Blessings</h4>
<p><strong>The basic space of emptiness</strong> is the great secret treasury of all the buddhas. Inspired by the music of meditative concentration, <strong>the radiance of the play of</strong> non-referential <strong>compassion</strong>, which has the nature of blessings<strong>, arises unceasingly</strong> in the sky of the merit of disciples and aspirations, <strong>like</strong> <strong>clouds gathering in the sky</strong> and then disappearing again. On the <strong>relative</strong> level the ritual purifies the grasping at the true existence of the maá¹á¸ala of compounded <strong>substances</strong> that possess <strong>characteristics</strong>, which <strong>transforms into the great maá¹á¸ala of</strong> truly established wisdom and <strong>original</strong>, natural <strong>purity.</strong></p>
<h4>7. Blessing the Offering Substances</h4>
<p>The <strong>outer offerings</strong> are the five regular offerings; the <strong>inner</strong> offerings are medicine, bali and rakta; <strong>and</strong> the <strong>secret</strong> offerings the great empty bliss. On the relative level, they <strong>all</strong> without exception merely <strong>appear</strong> <strong>as</strong> the samaya <strong>substances, yet in nature</strong> they <strong>are wisdom ambrosia</strong> perfect in <strong>taste</strong> and potency and <strong>containing the glory of a hundred</strong> rich qualities. Imagine that this <strong>becomes the most exquisite offering that delights the deities of the maá¹á¸ala</strong> and bless it with its own mantra.</p>
<h3>II. The Main Part</h3>
<p>This has seven parts.</p>
<h4>1. Generating the Supporting Palace and the Supported Deities</h4>
<p><strong>From within</strong> <strong>the state</strong> of suchness <strong>without ground or basis</strong>, where <strong>all phenomena</strong> that consist of confused appearances <strong>are free of conceptual</strong> reference, the radiance of <strong>the union of basic space</strong>âpurity and equality, emptinessâ<strong>and</strong> the dharmatÄ of <strong>awareness arises as the</strong> wisdom <strong>realm of great purity.</strong> Here the seed syllables and layered elements are not fabricated things imputed by the mind; rather, <strong>my entire perception,</strong> primordially and <strong>spontaneously perfect, is the Potala Mountain</strong>âappearances of the radiance of wisdom.</p>
<p>In the centre of the finest golden ground is a clear, unsullied lake whose water has the eight purities and which is filled with wish-fulfilling gems. It is a place of ravishing beauty adorned with water birds and lotuses, kumuda and puá¹á¸arÄ«ka flowers. Precious bees of various colours hover and buzz with the sound of the Dharma of the three vehicles. All around there are magnificent mountain peaks where sages and vidyÄdharas who possess the many doors of samÄdhi abide. In this way, this unsurpassed pure realm is full of all the <strong>symbols</strong> without exception of the dharmas of enlightenment. The <strong>signs and characteristics are perfect</strong>, as illustrated by the design and measurements of the palace. In this realm all the phenomena of the ground, path and fruition are cleansed through purification, perfection and maturation. As a sign of not abiding in either existence or peace, or of abiding in saá¹sÄra while remaining untainted by its faults there is a <strong>multi-coloured, thousand-petalled lotus.</strong> </p>
<p>In relation to purifiying the four types of birth and the associated habitual tendencies of existence, for the purification of birth from warmth and moisture, the <strong>sun-disk seat</strong> purifies warmth and the <strong>moon-disk seat</strong> purifies moisture. The seed-syllable <strong>hrÄ«á¸¥</strong> purifies the grasping in the consciousness of beings in the intermediate state. Whichever state of development the aggregates, elements and sense sources of beings are in, the Noble Oneâthe embodiment of the skilful means of great compassion and the deity of great compassionâsees them all. He then liberated all these six types of beings of the three realms with all their fears caused by the three types of suffering in their natural place. <strong>AvalokiteÅvara</strong> never ceases to gaze compassionately from the corners of his eyes<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> at all sentient beings. As a sign that he turns the ever-revolving wheel of benefitting beings, his body is in a <strong>standing posture</strong>. <strong>The palms of his two main hands are joined at his heart while the remaining two hold a mÄlÄ and lotus,</strong> just like Lord Khasarpaá¹i. The ornaments and costumes of the <strong>saá¹bhogakÄya form</strong> are easy to understand, yet he has three special features: his <strong>complexion is white</strong> with a distinct <strong>tinge of red</strong>; he wears the six <strong>bone ornaments</strong>; and a deerskin covers his left breast. Besides this, concerning <strong>the nine peaceful expressions</strong>, the <em>Magnificent [Wisdom] Lightning Tantra</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They are soft, well-proportioned,<br/>
Firm, supple, and youthful;<br/>
Clear, radiant, attractive,<br/>
And blazing with intense presence.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the thirteen ornaments, the seven jewelled ornaments are added to the five ornaments<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> of enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities and activities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crown, earrings, necklace,<br/>
Armlets, anklets,<br/>
Long necklace and crystal necklace:<br/>
These are the seven jewelled ornaments.<br/>
The upper garment of white silk of the <em>body</em>.<br/>
The violet red Dharma robe of the <em>speech</em>.<br/>
The deep blue silken scarf of the <em>mind</em>.<br/>
The gold-coloured belt of the <em>qualities</em>.<br/>
The emerald-coloured undergarment of <em>activities</em>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The powerful radiance of the skilful means of great compassion thus appears in bodily form. As a sign that his form never parts from insight into emptiness, there are four secret consorts, <strong>each seated on a four-petalled lotus</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In the east</strong> is <strong>Venerable TÄrÄ, her body white in colour</strong>, with her right hand in the gesture of supreme generosity, holding an utpala flower, and her left hand in the gesture of equanimity, holding a long-life vase containing bodhicittaâcoiling auspiciouslyâ resting upon a moon-disk.</p>
<p><strong>In the south</strong> is <strong>MÄrÄ«cÄ«, yellow in colour.</strong> Her expression is semi-wrathful and with the corner of her eyes she looks upwards to the principal deity. Her right hand holds a wish-fulfilling jewel at her heart and her left hand holds aloft a sun and moon lasso. Her legs are in striding posture, with her left leg bent and right leg outstretched.</p>
<p><strong>In the west</strong> is <strong>KurukullÄ, red in colour.</strong> She has one face and four arms, with her main hands holding a bow and arrow of lotus flowers, her lower right hand an iron hook of lotus flowers and her lower left hand a lasso of lotus flowers. Her right leg is bent with her heel placed at her bhaga and her left leg is trampling on the breasts of UmÄ. She wears a tigerskin skirt and is adorned with the six bone ornaments and a garland of lotus flowers as long as her own body.</p>
<p><strong>In the north</strong> is <strong>VasudhÄrÄ, green in colour</strong> upon an overflowing vase of treasure. She is standing upright on her two feet and is adorned with jewellery. Her right hand holds a wish-fulfilling jewel, and her left hand a wish-fulfilling mongoose at her waist.</p>
<p><strong>At the four doors are the four HayagrÄ«vas</strong> upon lotus and sun disk seats and a rudra. The <strong>colours</strong> of their bodies <strong>match their particular activities</strong> and they hold <strong>hooked knives and skull-cups.</strong> Displaying the nine wrathful expressions, they are <strong>majestic and terrifying</strong> and are adorned <strong>with</strong> the eight <strong>wrathful ornaments.</strong></p>
<p>In the courtyards are the <strong>buddhas, bodhisattvas, vidyÄdharas,</strong> hosts of <strong>heroic ones</strong> and <strong>á¸ÄkinÄ«s and</strong> an ocean of <strong>samaya-bound Dharma protectors</strong>âin short, the entire jewel of the saá¹gha of the Great Vehicle (all those who have perfected the qualities of the grounds and paths) are <strong>gathered like clouds.</strong> In this way, the forms of all those in the samaya maá¹á¸ala appear yet don't have any real essence, like a rainbow. <strong>Appearing</strong> yet <strong>empty,</strong> empty yet <strong>vividly present and unobscured. The deities' three centres</strong>âat their crown, throat and heartâ<strong>are</strong> <strong>marked with the three seed syllables</strong> oá¹, Äá¸¥ and hÅ«á¹, which have the nature of the vajra body, speech, mind and wisdom of all the buddhas. They bless your ordinary three doors as the three vajras, and they are the profound interdependent circumstance through which all the qualities of the ground, path and fruition are perfected. <strong>From</strong> them <strong>light streams out to the natural, supreme abode</strong> of the genuine, profound and peaceful space free from any conceptions; <strong>the</strong> illusion-like, supreme <strong>nirmÄá¹akÄya pure land of Potala</strong> where beings are tamed; the thirty-two lands which illustrate the grounds, paths and doors of liberation; <strong>the twenty-four sacred places</strong>; <strong>and the eight charnel grounds, inviting the</strong> maá¹á¸ala of <strong>wisdom deities.</strong> With the words of the great vajra samayaâ<strong>vajra-samÄjaá¸¥</strong>âyou invoke and invite them.</p>
<h4>2. Invitation</h4>
<p>Although the pure realm and those who are invited from it are not truly existent, since ordinary beings are used to viewing things as real and since the nature of reality accords with conditions and aspirations, as a means of attaining the two kinds of accomplishment the invitation corresponds to mundane expressions of honour and reverence. Carry out the invitation while burning incense and reciting with a beautiful melody: <strong>HrÄ«á¸¥! From the Mighty Palace of Great Bliss in the West</strong>. The hosts of gurus, personal deities, buddhas and bodhisattvas arrive and fill the sky, then merge with the samaya maá¹á¸ala.</p>
<h4>3. Requesting the Deities to be Seated</h4>
<p>For the Noble Ones who have seen the profound truth of reality the invitation and so on are merely conventional imputations; they <strong>are beyond reference</strong> as objective phenomena. For the <strong>naturally liberating and compassionate</strong> wisdom <strong>maá¹á¸ala</strong> of the dharmatÄ, <strong>there is no coming, arriving, or remaining. Yet to purify the adventitious stains of</strong> the <strong>duality</strong> of the grasping subject and the grasped at object, the objects of purification of our buddha nature element, request the <strong>samaya-being and wisdom-beingâ</strong>primordially <strong>inseparableâ</strong> to <strong>please remain here firmly</strong>. Do this with great confidence in their wisdom and complete purity.</p>
<h4>4. Prostration</h4>
<p>The <strong>Blessed One</strong>, the Accomplished Conqueror,<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> has completely conquered the emotional and cognitive obscurations and has accomplished the two purities. To this Noble Buddha, the embodiment of great <strong>compassion</strong>, <strong>and</strong> <strong>the hosts of deities I prostrate symbolically,</strong> as a sign of the realization of the naturally arisen wisdom <strong>free from confusion.</strong> Just as the <strong>gods of Enjoying Emanation</strong> make use of enjoyments that they themselves <strong>emanate</strong>, this practice transcends all notions of acceptance or rejection based on viewing the object of <strong>prostration</strong> and the agent of prostration as good or bad. So as to develop confidence in the realization that the deity is identical with oneself, I have here elaborated on the meaning of prostration. </p>
<h4>5. Offerings</h4>
<p>Arrange a few actual offerings as a support for your visualization, then, just as with the display of the bodhisattva <strong>Samantabhadraâs</strong> meditative concentration, mentally emanate offerings that include the five regular offerings, the <strong>five</strong> goddesses of <strong>sensual delights</strong> such as the Vajra Lady of Form and all the worldly <strong>riches</strong> and enjoyments of the worlds of <strong>gods and humans</strong>, their parks, mansions, ornaments and clothing: <strong>all of this I offer.</strong></p>
<h4>6. Special Offerings</h4>
<p>The <strong>wondrous</strong> samaya <strong>substances</strong> that engender the wisdom of <strong>great bliss</strong> are <strong>superior</strong> to those of the lower tantras. They are the medicinal <strong>ambrosia</strong> with eight major and a thousand minor ingredients; a vast array of <strong>tormas</strong>; the <strong>rakta</strong> with thirty-five ingredients that purifies and reverses the progressive evolution of saá¹sÄra; the enjoyments of the gaá¹acakra; the illusory vajra queen or (when the name of the result is given to the cause, she is called) <strong>the wisdom consort</strong> who is skilled in the arts and inspires the wisdom of the four joys. Then we request the genuine accomplishment (which is based on the third empowerment's wisdom of example) of the inconceivable wisdom of the fourth empowerment, <strong>which is beyond mind</strong> and whose essence is the offering of MahÄmudrÄ.</p>
<h4>7. Offering Praise</h4>
<p>The <strong>basic space</strong> is the profound, peaceful expanse <strong>beyond elaboration</strong>, which we conventionally designate as <strong>the</strong> <strong>palace</strong>. It does not pertain to the ordinary conceptual mind. The wisdom aspect of natural <strong>spontaneous presence</strong> radiates outwardly as the <strong>saá¹bhogakÄya</strong> endowed with the five certainties and seven aspects of union. <strong>You arise</strong> in this form <strong>with mastery</strong> over an ocean of major and minor marks. You manifest once again in a form body that is perfect in all aspects, as a <strong>great treasure</strong> of <strong>boundless</strong> and endless <strong>compassion</strong> for all beings. Here <strong>I offer praise to you</strong> in accord with your qualities.</p>
<p>In this way <strong>AvalokiteÅvara</strong> is forever carrying out the enlightened activities of the <strong>four immeasurables</strong> as he skilfully <strong>guides all beings on the path of liberation</strong> and omniscience<strong>. With the dance of</strong> his emanations and <strong>compassion,</strong> he <strong>tames each according to their needs</strong> and carries out enlightened activities with <strong>the power to miraculously transform in various forms</strong>, such as the <strong>ladies of the four families.</strong> Their forms of activity are as follows: TÄrÄ grants longevity; MÄrÄ«cÄ« tames obstructive forces; KurukullÄ magnetizes; and VasudhÄrÄ increases wealth. And so <strong>I offer praise</strong> to these four emanated goddesses.</p>
<p><strong>With mastery of all four enlightened activities</strong> of pacifying, enriching, magnetizing and wrath and the <strong>display of wrathful fury that subdues misleading forces</strong>, the <strong>HayagrÄ«va</strong> gatekeepers <strong>of the four families</strong> enact their unbearably wrathful enlightened activities.</p>
<p>And so <strong>I praise</strong> the nine main deities, the <strong>entire maá¹á¸ala of deities</strong> including an inconceivable number of guests.</p>
<p>The eighth section of mantra recitation with the emanation and reabsorption of light rays and so on is clear within the text itself. </p>
<p>The consecration of pills that liberate upon taste is described in the <em>Pratri</em> commentary.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a></p>
<p><em>Dzogchenpa Rangjung Dorje wrote this in response to the insistent requests, accompanied by twelve silver coins, of the fully ordained monk Rintengpa from the Dharma centre of GyangtsÃ© Palkhor,<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> who considers this deity alone as the most extraordinary and supreme.</em></p>

<p>The Tibetan translation of the Skt. <em>BhagavÄn</em> (in English translated as <em>Blessed One</em>), <em>chomdendÃ© (bcom ldan 'das)</em>, is often glossed according to the three meaning units of the word: conquered (<em>bcom</em>, pronounced <em>chom</em>), possessing or accomplished (<em>ldan</em>; pronounced <em>den</em>) and transcendent (<em>'das</em>; pronounced <em>dÃ©</em>). Here the word is abbreviated to only its first two semantic units, 'conquered' (<em>bcom; chom</em>) and 'possessing/accomplished' (<em>ldan; den</em>), and so only these are glossed. <a href="#fnref:5" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
